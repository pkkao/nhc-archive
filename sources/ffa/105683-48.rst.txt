 Why do I even bother trying to stay positive when the outcome is always awful?

 It's beside the entrance door.
 
 Never mind what I posted earlier (I even have deleted that post) There hasn't been any luck at all. I will never find love ever.

 Have you considered Tinder or OKCupid? I downloaded Tinder yesterday and am scheduled to meet a guy in about an hour.

 Did she say no or could you not go through with it?

 I never had a chance to ask. She right away said I was sweet but that she already had a boyfr...

 Yeah, stuff came up that prevented that. I have no idea what to expect of this.

 Why let a thing like a boyfriend get in the way of true love. I bet you he's a jerk to her and you can save her from him

 I despise Tinder with every fiber in my body. How is OKCupid? It better not be a pay-per-month site.
 
 Also, believe me, I've tried before, even harder than ever, to get a girl to like me even when I have found out they have a partner. It never works and the worst case was when I tried in almost a year after the news. I would never want to go back to that horrifying road again.¨
 
 Edit: Never mind, that damn site doesn't even have "Sweden" as an option when it comes to which country you are from.
 
 Edit 2: Never mind, it actually did.

 Been 20 minutes and he hasn't shown up. I expected this, but I'm still mad.

 So maybe Panther is into guys. Does it fuckin matter? We don't have to be assholes for the sake of being an asshole.

 Of all the things to banter about with Panther I don't think being into guys is very high up the list.

 This guy better show up soon, Panther or you won't get the chance to charm the pants off him.

 I gave up. He never even responded to my message.

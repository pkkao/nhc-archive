 How do you know you're ugly though? Has anyone told you? Surprisingly, I always thought I was ugly too but I've been unironically called good looking by a few people. Like everyone thinks they're ugly. I bet you look fine.

 ok, il list all teh things wrong ok, Pale, big head, big forehead, weak jaw, chin that pokes out over the jaw so it looks slightly odd, dimple chin, pointy nose, fat(ish) lips, big brow bone, blonde eye brows (looks like i have non) rounder shaped head (although not too round my jaw makes my head look rounder)  and yeah there ya go i hope ive cleared tings up

 That post tugged at my jawstrings.
 
 Seriously though, fuck what other people say. If they call you ugly, that says more about themselves than you. Self confidence is important, and I guarantee you that there are people who care about who you are and won't just write you off by your looks. But if you for some reason haven't found somebody yet who isn't a shallow asshole, I promise you still will.

 well tbf if i wasnt so lazy and tanned slightly and dyed my hair and eyebrows i might not look as bad, but yeah idk


.. admonition:: Grifty McGrift (Joined Oct 2013, 5,312 posts) on 09-13-2016, 06:48 AM
 
 Haven't seen you so can't say, but it honestly seems like an overreaction. I mean ffs, don't you see like super model esque girls go "Oh my gosh im so ugly!". You probably aren't ugly and yeah, don't care what other people say.

 I get ripped on for being 'ugly' all the time. I literally can't remember a day where someone didn't comment on something, be it my beard, my hair, hell even my ears. I shaved the other day and I still get ripped on. it gets to the point where you just gotta stop caring and remember people are gonna say what they're gonna say; it doesn't mean it's true. I'd be lying if I said it doesn't hurt my self-esteem, but... it's just people's opinions, and usually, it's just them trying to bring you down just to bring you down.

 its completely out of order though that people feel they have the right to comment on you i hate it when people think that they are better then someone because of looks, although noone really comments on my looks its still super annoying, i have a beard to but thats to slightly cover my weak jawline but my dad sometimes keeps saying you need a shave but im like i have a beard for a reason ugh haha

 trust me when I say I've been ripped on for several stupid things, not just limited to my face, but pretty much everything and anything. for crying out loud, in middle school one of my friends literally counted how many words I could write on one line, because my handwriting use to be so big and sloppy(now it's just sloppy...). which is another reason I just stopped caring when people insult me or try to put me down

 I have big ears. No one has really commented on them but fuck they're ugly.

 Haha I've actually thought of doing something like that. Not super glue though. But something.

 I think a lot about dating/having people intereated in you is confidence. I feel like looks play a very small factor. I mean i'm pretty average looking (appearance and weight wise) and I can't even get a guy to talk to me. I think it's due to my crippling social anxiety, and lack of self esteem more than anything.  I've seen people that I would consider less attractive than me be the center of attention/be in plentiful relationships. I also see far more attractive people in relationships too so I don't even know....Beauty isn't everything though. Beauty is nothing you can't start a conversation or engage with someone in the first place.
 
 I feel like i'll be alone forever cause i'll never have the confidence to do anything to help to not be single. It seems like it's too much work and I have this fear that i'll never be good enough for the other person. Like I don't deserve to be with anyone.

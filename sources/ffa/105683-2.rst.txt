 oss dude, you need to space out your replies a bit. don't get too caught up in a fleeting crush or it automatically puts you in the subordinate role, and she'll see you as a beta male. make her work for your attention, not the other way around.

 But I don't want to feel like a bitch...
 I just want to be nice to her.

 The only way you're going to seem like a bitch is by openly pining over a girl. If you meant you don't want to feel like a dick, it doesn't make you a dick. Being a dick is insulting someone's integrity, just because you've got better things to do than be at her beck and call it doesn't make you an asshole. Get confidence and the world will fit in around you. It's a stress-free way of living.

 For a second I thought this said "how do you act when you crush someone?"
 
 (I think I just pitched an idea for a parody thread.)

 I swear, reading OSS posts is like reading my own moments of teenage angst in text form. It's the most bizarre thing.

 My friend just keeps nagging about a assumedly great pick-up class all the time.
 If only he could shut the hell up about it already! I don't want to have sex with a person if I don't have feelings for her! I mean, sure, it would feel nice and all that, but afterwards, what's the point?


.. admonition:: DoctorMcGann (Joined Mar 2014, 1,817 posts) on 09-19-2014, 06:53 PM
 
 Doesn't matter, had sex.


.. admonition:: OldSchoolerSimpsons (Joined Aug 2013, 15,333 posts) on 09-23-2014, 08:31 AM
 
 If I want to ask her if she wants to do something, how long should I wait?
 Should I go for feeling or reaction?

 OSS, you were kind of rude to Monty Burns when he had a question about girls and was paranoid, but you're doing exactly the same thing.

 Well, he didn't even have a problem in the first place. It was already going superwell for him and still he kept worrying about that supervisor.
 I don't know if it's going well or not. I see no reason to worry but also no reason not to.
 I want a minimum risk of her saying no, so I just want some advice.

 whenever I've ever liked anybody I always just stay all extra quiet around them. occasionally talk to them but it's pretty rare because I try too hard to think of something to say.
 
 next time I have a crush on someone i'm going for it because why not, I have nothing to lose.


.. admonition:: OldSchoolerSimpsons (Joined Aug 2013, 15,333 posts) on 09-23-2014, 09:41 AM
 
 @Walid Whatever you do, don't think too much of what to say. Tell a joke. Say something stupid. Hell, even talk about the damn weather! The less time it takes for you to say something, the better.
 It's harder with someone who is shy, but still not impossible.


.. admonition:: Walid (Joined Jun 2009, 33,032 posts) on 09-23-2014, 09:43 AM
 
 I've grown quite a bit out of my shyness problems when I realized I just don't care what people think of me. obviously i'm not going to be an asshole to everyone, but even if i'm nice to someone and they're not to me, oh well.
 
 it's also really hard to meet people when I'm staying at the homeless shelter.

 @mutilated_lips  @Financial Panther I'm not worried without reason, because I'm so tired of getting a "no thanks" all the time. And I hate when I get asked "Is it a date?" How the FUCK should I answer that? If I say it is, it might result in a no, but if I say it isn't, I'm a fucking liar.

 if you say it is a date and someone says no, they dont want to date you.

 Update: I'll feel like I shouldn't contact them EVEN if I have a very reasonable reason.

 That's the problem, don't you see? I can't know if I'd get a "no" or not!

 For EVERYONE to spread their angst!

 you'll know once you ask. i understand it's nerve-wracking. i wrestle with fear of rejection every single day. but if you live in fear and tip toe around the real questions, there definitely won't be an answer and no relationship will grow. if you get a "no", at least you'll have closure on the fear.

 I'm the least qualified person to talk about dating on here (then again, most of us are single dorks anyway - no offense), but if you're shy around this person now, what makes you think you won't be equally afraid/shy on a date? If you shy away from her, chances are you don't know her well enough to date her anyway.

 @Financial Panther No one actually discriminates autistic people tho. Well there ARE people who do, but theres also homophobes and racist haters will always exist. But autistic people aren't so discriminated against that they need "rights".

 A disproportional amount of people on the autism spectrum are jobless and homeless, and those that do have a job are often relegated to menial tasks. When a person on the spectrum reaches adulthood, nearly all the resources are taken away. There are very, very few resources out there for adults with autism. Everything one reads is about children with autism because it's what garners public sympathy. There are numerous false "facts" about people with autism such as how they supposedly lack empathy. The public is about 30 years behind where they should be when it comes to knowledge about autism, and that includes many therapists and psychiatrists. There is not as much blatant discrimination against autistics as there has been against the aforementioned groups, but it exists and it needs to change.

 Society disables us by making it difficult to get shit done when you suffer from such mental/physical problems. I wouldn't say specifically autistic people, but invisible disability as an umbrella is under-campaigned about. Also, the issues intersect. Have any of you got a concept of how statistically likely your life is to suck if you're a poor, gay, overweight, physically and mentally disabled woman of colour? Words like "retard" and "spaz" can go to hell. Discrimination comes from the core belief that you're superior to another person based on __________.

 Actually, I'm not against the word "retard" being used as an insult. It works as a variation to call someone dumb. "Autism" as an insult however, that insinuates you think autism itself is a terrible disease.

 well people with disabilities (which is what autistic adults fall under) are far, far more protected than those groups whose "rights" have been achieved. it's fine if you want to advocate better education and a positive image of those with autism, but the issues all of the groups you mentioned are far worse. like @kes said, the issues can intersect, but on its own I wouldn't just push those others to the side like you insinuated. that's pretty insulting to those who are dealing with those issues currently.

 I'm not trying to push them to the side; I'm simply saying that while I'm aware prejudice against them still exists, their rights have advanced at a quicker pace than those of autistic people have.

 That's because autistic people as a group make up less of the population. Can we get some stats on all invisible disabilities?

 Ah okay.
 I'm not. I mean, I went at a special education school for three years, so maybe I was back then. But right now, can't say I am.

 what actual real legal discrimination that's on the level of other minority groups have autistic men and women in the USA have to face today that hasn't been covered by ADA laws?

 Considering I've shared so much about my personal life here, I don't think it's very difficult. I just see it as a chapter of my life, not a big deal.

 Well, they're not allowed in the military, for the one thing. They havem't faced as much legal discrimination, and that's a good thing, but it could also hurt because people may think autistics are treated just fine because there aren't many laws that discriminate against them.

 Spare a thought for those in society who can't "pass" as "normal". They have no choice but to be honest about things most of us would hide.

 And that, along with a NUMBER of things that military enlistment could use a re-organization of, which includes yes, other disabled. Gays were literally just allowed to enroll freely into the military. 
 
 But otherwise, it's not nearly on the level of what other minority groups have had to deal with. Just be more sensitive of what exactly you're comparing things too. Discrimination is a touchy topic.

 Ryan, you do realize the ADA didn't just erase discrimination? I say this as someone who is both queer and disabled, no my physical and mental health issues are not "more protected" except in states/counties with zero protection for sexual orientation or gender identity. All discrimination cases can be very difficult to prove.
 
 By the way, I was fired from my last job in violation of the ADA. Luckily I was able to prove it and collect unemployment.

 I'm not saying that. There's troubles in a lot of various systems. I'm just saying it's insensitive to say "well gays, blacks and other oppressed groups have gotten their due, what about autistic people?!"
 
 Literally, that's all. If you're disabled of course there'll be trials especially if you fall into a number of other categories but I'm not talking about the wide scope here.

 Agree insofar as it's insensitive. Though, so is assuming that because it's granted as a protected characteristic that means we have equality.

 Well I didn't agree with that post at all, obv. (Especially the wording) But I also take issue with people minimizing discrimination against the disabled just because we have a law.

 I'm glad at least that in Sweden autism was finally recognized as a diagnosis in 1996. Before there was an awareness about autism, people pretty much only thought their kids were stupid! Scary.

 there is always going to be discrimination against all groups. but when you put the wording of "rights" out there, well... I'm sure you get my point.

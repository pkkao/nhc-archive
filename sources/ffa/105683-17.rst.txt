 Yeah, you're calculating this too much, Panther. It's only going to make you stumble in real life. Focus on feeling comfortable during a conversation instead of trying to rehearse what to do before you even have one

 Ironically, that statement is also dating advice

 In all seriousness, if you actually want a girlfriend/boyfriend and not a meaningless hook up, you have to be completely genuine with the person. Finding someone to be with isn't just about having someone you can brag about and smoosh genitals with, it needs to be someone you are comfortable and honest with, someone that you can enjoy your time with, and you can't have that without being yourself. And if you aren't ready to just be you, you aren't ready to have a girlfriend or boyfriend. If you're in a relationship because you just want a relationship, it isn't going to be a happy one. Yeah, having someone to share your time with is great, but it's not that great if you aren't happy. 
 
 Forcing stuff isn't going to help anyone, it just makes you seem weird and desperate. Just LET IT HAPPEN. If things don't come about through a natural course, it probably isn't meant to happen. Basically everyone talking about this stuff is quite young anyway, this is not the end of your dating life if something doesn't happen in the next few months. Calm down and go with the flow. You will be less stressed and less terrifying to anyone you are interested in.

 you meant when you don't have to learn how to talk with women? that's true but It's not "talking to women" that is the crux, it's letting desirable women know that you're up for  that people want to hax, and what I assume zach meant no one requires advice for
 wait i'm being petty/whatever
 
 very stern

  sorry if I'm reading you wrong here
 
 Not what i mean, i just mean that people who are to overthinking like Finan-panther should just remember they will not bite your hed off.

 This is what i think.
 
 Snowpit should stop posting whenever he get anxious because that hurt to read.
 Panther should not basse his future on whether or not he can abide by internet ruele.
 
 Is that Simple Enough for you,

 I do agree that Panther should stop reading internet articles on flirting.


.. admonition:: Elliot76 (Joined Aug 2013, 4,647 posts) on 02-24-2015, 02:46 PM
 
 but he should probably keep on researching through a simpsons message board

 For some reason I'm wondering now how zachbigmac is doing with the ladies himself.

 If you want a one night stand just download a good "dating" app for your iPad.

 There have been many misspellings of my username, but Snowpit is still my favorite. It sounds pretty cool actually.

 Deleted the post because I didn't think it would be received well. Glad I got some (I hope) genuine advice.

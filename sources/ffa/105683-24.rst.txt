 Eh... it would look awkward to those unfamiliar with Mission Hill.

 um i'm not familiar with your av/usertitile now so it's awkward to me!!

 I'm sure it isn't as awkward as seeing "penis" written 5 times.

 Freak out when they post "Happy birthday " on my Facebook wall and then not ask them to hang out.
 
 Get suicidal for unrelated reasons (bipolar) and still not ask them to hang out, even though they understand.
 
 Ask to meet their gecko. Get told, "Maybe tomorrow would be good." Wonder if it's the gecko or them that's not good today.
 
 Rinse and repeat.
 
 Rinse and repeat.
 
 Buy a gecko.
 
 Freak out when they like my photos.
 
 Tell them I've bought three more geckos. (Not a lie.)
 
 Aww over reptiles together.
 
 Get soppy and tell them how I feel.
 
 Say, "Excuse me while I throw up, now."
 
 Cry for twenty minutes in the bathroom.
 
 Go to check messages.
 
 Get told, "Don't worry about it."
 
 Go to friend's to cry some more.
 
 Cheer up. Check messages.
 
 Back to normal.
 
 Get told not to worry about it again.
 
 Feel squishy when they overenthusiastically like my Facebook post.
 
 Not feel empty any more.
 
 Feel like I have a really special friend.
 
 
 
 I love you, Eden, and I don't care who knows.

 Don't worry, I'm pretty sure i'm overreacting. We went a little bit without talking but mostly because she was busy with uni work, but as far as i'm aware we're still meeting and everything.

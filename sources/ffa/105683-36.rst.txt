 Accidentally start thinking about kissing them while watching a random Shakespeare.

 My crush won't have internet again until Sunday, so there is no way for me to contact her

 really nervous about seeing my crush in a few days time. i'd say there's at least a 50% chance things will go how i want them to.

 That's almost as good as the votes for Obama in the latest election!

 So many layers of deepness.

 so I uh actually had to do the things I didn't want to do because my dad said so
 
 the soccer game was so uncomfortable because I just kept fidgeting in my seat wanting to go. ended up watching the game on a TV out in the hallway in the stadium as I charged my phone on one of the free charger things they have, I spent nearly all my battery texting her cause she was scared during a movie 
 
 anyway, I got there and we had fun. she looked really nice but I didn't get the courage to tell her unfortunately. I kinda stumbled a few of my words and jokes and probably sounded really lame but I made her laugh a lot. let her win at mario kart too, but only barely. I may not be coming first place but I can guarantee I won't be out of the top 3
 
 anyway when I left i told her thanks for having me at your place cause my mum is always adamant on manners and she laughed and said I didn't have to thank her and it was really her pleasure and I made the night better for her
 
 then she texted me the next morning saying that she had a lot of fun last night and was really glad I showed up 
 
 holy fuck I'm in deep here guys. teehee

 Since this thread seems really active, does anyone have any advice for how to handle a crush?


.. admonition:: OldSchoolerSimpsons (Joined Aug 2013, 15,333 posts) on 11-02-2015, 10:10 AM
 
 Depends on how it has gone for you so far.


.. admonition:: Johnny Deformed (Joined Nov 2012, 20,889 posts) on 11-02-2015, 10:11 AM

 We'll we're friends. That's a start. right?

 All right fine, I'll explain it if you promise to quit whinin'.
 
 In the latest election Obama only barely made it, with 51 percent of the votes or so. That's what I meant when I said the chances are almost as good as Obama's win in the latest election.

 Yeah, certainly. Especially if you've met her/him outside of school a couple of times.


.. admonition:: BloodySimpsonChibi (Joined Apr 2015, 1,904 posts) on 11-02-2015, 10:17 AM

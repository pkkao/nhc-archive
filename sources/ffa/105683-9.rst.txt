 All right...I'm going to say something to Martha tomorrow that shows her I like her. I don't know what, or how, or when, but I will! Get ready, MarthaPanther's gonna put his CLAWS into you!

 Oh my God...
 Are you sure it's such a good idea?

 Seriously though, we have become really close friends. Maybe I'll just casually ask if she still has a boyfriend or something...

 Panther. That is not something you ask casually.


.. admonition:: Financial Panther (Joined Aug 2007, 26,500 posts) on 10-30-2014, 04:17 PM
 
 Oh...
 
 Then how do I do it?


.. admonition:: DoctorMcGann (Joined Mar 2014, 1,817 posts) on 10-30-2014, 04:19 PM
 
 I mean....that's just not something you ask unless you're pretty certain the answer's no. It just comes off really odd if they do still have an SO.


.. admonition:: Financial Panther (Joined Aug 2007, 26,500 posts) on 10-30-2014, 04:22 PM
 
 Okay...what about, "How's your boyfriend doing?"


.. admonition:: DoctorMcGann (Joined Mar 2014, 1,817 posts) on 10-30-2014, 04:23 PM
 
 That sounds like a better way of doing it. Doesn't make it immediately obvious what your intentions are.


.. admonition:: Financial Panther (Joined Aug 2007, 26,500 posts) on 10-30-2014, 04:26 PM
 
 All right, then that's what I'll go with. Thanks for your help!


.. admonition:: The Goode Family (Joined Jan 2013, 11,702 posts) on 10-30-2014, 04:29 PM
 
 the next day
 
 panther: hi, so, uh, how are you, uh... doing, erm... your... boyfriend...?

 If you ask about a boyfriend in any sort of way she is going to get what you are trying to figure out. It won't matter how you ask it, unless she's perhaps totally dense.
 
 Panther I would really just go with instinct for now. Things happen more naturally when you do it your way.

 The thing is though, I feel like all of my past possibilities with girls evaporated because I was too afraid to say anything about it. If the boy is the one who is expected to ask, when the hell do I do it?

 Do it whenever you want to know

 I've postponed it, since we had to study for a test this morning. Martha and I studied together. I saw her texting someone; I'm afraid it might have been her boyfriend. I ultimately decided against asking who she was talking to.

 That was like a perfect opportunity, it saved you having to just bring up the topic out of nowhere and could have just been a casual remark about what's going on, instead of a seemingly planned question. If she said yes you could have just swept it off without it being awkward and if she said 'No I don't have one?' you could have just been like 'Oh I thought you did? Sorry.'
 Both would achieve the goal of you finding out, and she'd probably catch on that you may like her a little bit without it being too dramatic or obvious.


.. admonition:: Financial Panther (Joined Aug 2007, 26,500 posts) on 10-31-2014, 07:36 AM
 
 If she said yes to what? "Are you talking to your boyfriend?"


.. admonition:: Elliot76 (Joined Aug 2013, 4,647 posts) on 10-31-2014, 07:37 AM
 
 Yes


.. admonition:: Elliot76 (Joined Aug 2013, 4,647 posts) on 10-31-2014, 07:42 AM
 
 The thing is, there never will be a moment when you want to do it because it's scary to do so.
 There will very unlikely be a moment when everything clicks into place and you go 'yes, this is the right time!' It could happen, but it's doubtful. 
 I agree with the advice that you should trust your instincts, but it also gets to the point where sometimes you have to just go out on a whim and say it, no matter how anxious it might feel to do so, and no matter how contrary to normal behaviour it may seem.  It only takes a few seconds of being brave, the outcome will take care of itself.
 But you know, easier said than done, etc.

 I'm sure I'll see her texting again on Monday. That's when I'll make my move.

I mentioned my major crush before in this thread (my college classmate whom I spent lots of free time with), but I was terrible about hiding my excitement whenever I hung out with her, so my husband caught on fairly quick to the fact that I WAS crushing on her. However, his reaction was not disappointment or anger, but supportive, positive. Hell, he was close to trying to convince her to make out w/ me at our grad party but that would've been strange w/ family there. Pretty sure she is straight, tho. Anyway, I am quite introverted and do not seek or make friends in person very easily (he is always trying to get me to call people or take them up on offers to go out) and she was essentially my best friend at the time, so that probably helped him just be like "All right, I can see that."  I knew there was no chance with her, he probably knew there was no chance, so crushing on my friend was really just caring for her a lot. I mean, if I have to be TMI here, we always talk about the idea of three-ways and junk (with girls, he doesn't like the idea of guys and that's fine with me) for the mutual flirty fun but we both know we'd never be able to go through with it because we're far too committed and possessive of each other. But just being able to talk/fantasize about it is a nice outlet/alternative to actually jeopardizing our relationship. Talking a lot helps a lot. Probably sounds strange but he boards here so I'm sure he could corroborate this if he needed to.
 
 Holy Hell, this thread has just been a real roller coaster of awkwardness. @Financial Panther, look if this girl you like has a boyfriend then my advice to you would be to try and let that shit play out however it's gonna play out. If she likes hanging out with you to the point where she develops feelings and she's not happy with her current BF, then it's up to her to dump him. Don't try to put any pressure on her one way or another outside of letting her know you like her should she give you some clear indication that she likes you because it's just gonna make you come off as pushy and decisions like that can be daunting enough as is.
 
 However, if she is happy with her current BF and simply enjoys hanging out with you as a friend, then don't try to wedge yourself between her and the BF, because then you'll risk losing her all together. I know crushes can suck with circumstances like this but in due time you can get over it and still be thankful that you have a good friend to show for not being all intense and awkward around them.
 
 I love these posts you make. Especially in threads like this. They provide a much needed balance and every time I see something about you and @D4C like this it just makes me smile and think "These two... these two have their shit figured out".

 Call them up at 6am drunk as fuck and attempt to tell them I love them but not actually be able to speak through the tears... apparently.

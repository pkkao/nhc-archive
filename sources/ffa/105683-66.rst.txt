 That's why I said convenience. Experience wise I've dealt with people like this a lot who only talk to me when they need something and have felt fairly used by them so I may be projecting here. There's nothing "wrong" with her reaching out for help, and definitely try to help if you feel the need but at some point you gotta think about your own well being when it's so draining and happens repeatedly.

 I dated two years younger. 15 and 17. It's not weird at that age, but I think more than two years is bad, and that two years is creepy if the younger is under 14. I don't know how much that has to do with having a brother four years younger and a best friend three years younger. I'd find it weirder dating an 18 year old now at 23 than I did dating a 16 year old at 18, and the 18 year olds are actually in my grade.

 It's going pretty fine so far with the girl on Tinder (even though I twice have been worried I would screw something up), but I'm beginning to face a problem: What should I talk with her about? I've talked to her about her hobbies, what kind of books, music, movies and TV she likes, how it's like where she lives, her family and we even have shared a few funny stories with each other. But is there something that is missing? Why does it feel like I'm starting to run out of stuff to talk about?
 We both are getting to know each other, but there has to be a natural flow of the conversation. I'm not saying I'm all out of words, only "What should I start asking or talking about now?" I honestly feel like I have been getting worse at this the last three days or so, and it makes me feel dumb. It's bad when I have to think like I'm coming up with a mathematical formula each time when I really should just be able to spontaneously write her a message.
 
 Help me out.

 this is essentially why I quit tinder, so im gonna second this general inquiry of oss' for future situations so that mayb I can feel less pressured.

 If you guys are actively watching the same TV shows or something at the same time, you could have recap/reaction sessions and stuff maybe.
 
 I don't exactly know how Tinder works though? I'm not sure if it's messages or messaging instantly... I'm more familiar with instant messaging which lends itself more to spontaneity like that. Dropping in random messages about what you're doing that moment and crap and hoping you get a response isn't exactly a fun way to try and strike up a convo but it's more or less what I do every where else and what I did through my entire long distance portion of the relationship. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
 
 Not exactly reassuring, I know. Gotta put the work in, though. The more you DO know about each other and the more comfortable you get knowing what is and isn't ok to talk about, the easier it gets to do that kind of stuff naturally and just spout off whatever.

 Just don't put pressure on yourself to be some crazy conversationalist. The person you're talking to on anyone of these online sites (and offline) are probably talking to a bunch of either people. You're young you don't need to be searching for love so hard. Just a few quick convos is enough to ask a person out on Tinder. My friend has gotten a date out writing "Down to Clown"? These people aren't going to be your true love or anything like that so just take it easy, see where shit goes.

 Is there like some sort of signal people give off to let others know that they're interested in them? Because i've never had a guy approach me/ask me out and I don't know what i'm doing wrong. Obviously I don't know how to flirt or any of that shit. The fact that i'm approaching 22 and never had been asked out is a little sad. I mean i'm not helping either by not approaching guys but im far too scared and everyone's out of my league. How do chill/shy nerds like me meet other like minded nerds? I'm not even particularly high maintenance or picky. I probably won't even say no to any guy asking cause the fact that anyone would ask to go out with me seems crazy.

 There's obviously tinder, and obviously it's scary but if you try to approach people I guarantee that if anyone thinks "what does she think she's doing I'm WAY out of her league" then he was no good anyway. No one's gonna think like that. It's really just flattering, people are just going to get happy if you tell them you're interested in them, even if they don't reciprotate. Be proactive, go for it!!
 I mean I don't know you, but don't short-sell yourself. If no one has asked to go out with you, then it's their loss. Take it from a stranger on the internet

 Aw thats sweet. Thanks for the advice. Isn't tinder mostly for hookups though?


.. admonition:: Tromboon (Joined Dec 2013, 1,783 posts) on 08-31-2016, 11:12 PM
 
 I know some people who have gotten into serious relationships via tinder, but yeah hook-ups is the deal. It's quite the confidence-boost, too

 I finally got the courage to send a friend request to that girl I like... because, you know, sending someone a facebook friend request is one of the scariest things in the world. I went to her profile and it says she's in a relationship 
 
 I wasn't really looking to be in a relationship or anything like that right now, it's just a matter of talking to her again. At the very least, I want to remain friends with her, and if that's all we got, then that's all we got. I'm hoping we can start talking more and maybe hang out because I miss her.

 I never even get to the point where I can fb request guys I like cause im too much of a wuss to even talk to them or ask for their name. Also im awful at remembering names in general.

 I always have a fear that whoever I sent a request to will ignore it or whatever. thank god she didn't... that would've sucked

 People tend to be pretty nice on fb esp if they know you. I think she would only ignore or deny it if you were a complete stranger.

 I've been seeing my crush a few times since I came back. Sad thing is, I've never had the best time to pull her aside and ask her out. She was at my fraternity's house party last night and I knew that wasn't the best place either.
 
 Then she started talking to one of my brothers and based on a post i saw online later, I'm pretty sure they're a thing now.
 
 
 Fuck. My. Life. Now I remember why I taught myself to enjoy being alone last year. Why do I have to fuck everything up? Life rarely gives second chances, just teases of shit you can't have.

 That's the thing. I haven't learned. This has been a five year agony that keeps haunting back in my life.

 Went to lunch alone today as I was late to catch up with some friends of mine. I'm used to it, so it's not a big deal to me. Out of the blue, a wonderful lady sat down at my table. I don't know who she is. We end up talking for a solid 20 minutes and she's just the nicest girl I've met here. We exchange information, will be meeting up for lunch again soon. My life turned around within one weekend.
 
 
 
 Oh did I mention she's had a boyfriend for three years?  I keep setting myself in this shit.

 sometimes life is full of surprises. nothing wrong with making a nice new lady friend

 Nah, it was a pleasant surprise. She's down-to-Earth, and honestly, I need to expand beyond the friends that I have. Nothing wrong with the ones I have, but sometimes I fear that people see one side of me too much now that if I try to tell them something seriously, it doesn't come out right. It's hard to explain

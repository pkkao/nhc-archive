 But... I guess things could be worse. I have a great female best friend who I enjoy talking to.

 well, then that's pretty fucking sweet mate. don't spend too much time browsing through dating sites, you're only 19 or whatever. just enjoy the friends you do have, you don't have to settle down and find a girlfriend right now.

 You have a friend? Lucky.

 What do you mean? I'm your friend, Panther.

 And I thank you for that. But online can't quite match a real-life friendship, which I've barely experienced since I entered college.

 So now I can't stop thinking about the guy I slept with last summer, and the guy I have a crush on now.
 
 My mind's not a great place to be in right now.

 Used tinder for one day and I've got a match already.  He's kinda hot too.
 
 Let's try not to fuck this up.
 
 EDIT: Three matches now. Noooo I didn't expect this.

 nah i just carried on talking to the first guy and had to ignore the other four (!). besides none of the other four have messaged me anyway so it doesn't seem like they're exactly devastated
 
 if the first guy is seriously into me then i don't really wanna mess with him by hooking up with other guys at the same time. had to miss out on some really hot guys though
 
 feels a little weird though. i haven't even got over my crush finally rejecting me on thursday night yet haha

 Oh Johnny Popinjay, you hedonistic raconteurial fop you.
 
 My advice, slow things down a touch and think 'what do I want out of a relationship?'. If it's sex then play the field and carry on by all means. If it's a relationship then slow down and think about who out of these fine boys can give you what you need and indeed what you can give to them.

 I've already arranged to meet a guy I've been talking to this weekend.

 *sigh* That's our Johnny!
 
 
 
 
 Just take care and stay safe.

 Drunk messages spoil everything. Think my 'crush' has finally had enough of my shit. Was always a difficult situation but doubt we'll ever be close now. Really awkward because she's seeing a guy in my friendship group. All a big mess! Tinder plz save me

 Actually don't understand why I bothered with the dating site. It's always those you've known for longer you get along better with.
 
 Today I chatted with someone for pretty much 8 hours!

 That's the beauty of having a reflection.

 Had a long talk with the girl I like's ex, and ugh he cheated on her, broke up the next day but didn't tell that to her, but thinks about her everyday and still loves her, and is marvelously depressed for all things he had done wrong to her.  (They were together for like a year and a half and broke up more than half a year ago) He hopes she'll be happy with someone else, but it hurts because in my naivety I'd hoped for him to tell me something cheering me up, like "you could be a good fit" or something, haha. Instead he says "If you get together with her, I'll hit you" and guh that hurts. But he's an honest guy, and I certainly can't judge him for just expressing how he feels. (Acting upon it is a different story) 
 He tells me about another guy that she should hook up with and be happy, and that makes me really anxious >.< It was a long time ago I used to wake up in the middle of night with death anxiety, but guh here I am.
 
 This is absolutely tragic  To love now seems like quite a chore. (And it's simply not practical to be infatuated with someone I haven't met IRL for so long to begin with. I can't shake the feeling that I'm typical or pathetic, because of it)
 
 Apparently they had got together by basically they were in the same room and he just went and kissed her. To me that seems romantic, but my friends think that's pretty messed up and that those two didn't fit together to begin with.

 Because I know you all care soooooooooooo much about Scully Apologist's love life!!! Might have salvaged something with the girl I'm into... went out for drinks tonight and it was so lovely. Keeps on sending me these sweet videos on facebook messenger. Don't know if i wanna risk ruining things again by adding a romantic element but I'm so relived that we're close again. Thought i'd fucked that up. Also very drunk so look forward to plenty of shit posting

 Well, at this point we're getting a little tired of hearing you think you fucked up when everything actually is fine, so I wasn't sure if I should reply. But I'm glad everything works out now again!
 
 But for your own sake, I seriously suggest you start cutting down on your drinking. You've noticed that it makes you act clumsily, which could be quite troubling if it goes on for too long.

 haha thats totally true. Been a rough couple of months, death in the fam and dissertation stress. Fair to say i drank far too much and was also too needy. Feeling stable atm though. Long may it last

 The difference is that I actually do.
 
 Wow, that sounded dark.

 Don't you just love it when you coincidentally bump into someone you like? 
 
 Looking forward to meeting her up next Saturday.


.. admonition:: Nicky (Joined Jul 2012, 7,009 posts) on 03-19-2016, 01:52 PM
 
 You might love it,  old boy but she'll be suspiciously peering over her shoulder from now on. 
 
 Up, eh? That's an odd euphemism.


.. admonition:: OldSchoolerSimpsons (Joined Aug 2013, 15,333 posts) on 03-19-2016, 02:10 PM
 
 Hey, she tapped on my shoulder. That means she saw me first.
 Besides, we were texting and she was going the same direction. I just didn't know we would see each other at the same bus stop.

 welp you already messed it up by making it a movie date


.. admonition:: Johnny Deformed (Joined Nov 2012, 20,889 posts) on 03-22-2016, 02:16 PM
 
 yeah like it's not exactly very social and you won't get much of a chance to talk or anything
 
 i think something like bowling would be a great first date actually

 I ended up taking my bf to a museum on our first date. It worked out really well, there were so many things to talk about.


.. admonition:: Nwordpassforsale (Joined Feb 2010, 2,651 posts) on 03-22-2016, 02:24 PM
 
 Maybe do a coffee or something after at least.


.. admonition:: OldSchoolerSimpsons (Joined Aug 2013, 15,333 posts) on 03-22-2016, 03:00 PM
 
 Yeah, that's a good excuse to continue hanging out with her. Talk about the movie, and along the way also about yourselves.

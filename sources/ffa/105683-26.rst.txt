 Your profile picture is hilariously fitting.
 Anyway, I don't see the problem. Like white light said, just write "Hi" back.
 Really, you have nothing to lose. You might even have something to win.

 My booty call is slowly slipping away...she's starting to get feelings and become interested.

 I haven't shown off anywhere near enough about this, but my newest crush is now my boyfriend and he's being adorable right now.

 Probably. I won't be seeing it because I am avoiding pretty much anything Paul Feig is directing these days and the majority of Melissa McCarthy films, but I think it's safe to assume that she'll eat it up.

 It depends, will it be packed or will it be empty?


.. admonition:: bias (Joined Dec 2014, 6,550 posts) on 06-07-2015, 10:28 PM

 so yesterday at the library, i was just sitting down where i usually sit, having my phone charge, when I see my old coworker from the first job i had. we made eye contact, and she didn't say anything to me. it sucked.
 
 i mean, i could have just as easily said something to her, but she was with a guy i'm assuming was her boyfriend, and i was shy{plus i was getting ready to head back to the mission}. i kind of regret not telling her how i felt back then, but at the same time, I really regret not saying anything yesterday. I'm hoping I'll see her again sometime in the future; even if she's with someone, I'll actually walk up and talk to her. It was just weird as hell because she was like my best friend at that job, and the last time we saw each other was a good 3-4 years ago. so I'm guessing/hoping she just didn't recognize me and that's why she didn't say anything

 Well if she is with her bf and she starts talking to you randomly it might look a bit odd, however she might also have just felt shy about it if you havnt spoken for years she might have also thought you wouldnt have recognised her. Also just becuase she didnt speak to you doesnt mean she doesnt have feelings for you or forgot about you but who knows. Its good that you will go speak to her next time you see her i wish you luck

 like i said, i'm only assuming it was her boyfriend. she wasn't really all that shy when we were working, so who knows. a simple "hi, how ya doing?" would've been nice though

 Me neither. My libido may finally be starting to recede a bit, so it doesn’t occupy my mind all the time. I’d still like a partner, if only to see what it’s like, but it’s not causing me major depression or giving me obsessive thoughts all the time. It’s nice.

 wow same here
 
 sure is nice to not be obsessing on a girl

 Last week I was reconnected with a friend I met at one of my temp jobs a couple years ago. I know he has a crush on me, and I do him. We spent all day together last Sunday and Monday, and I thought something was there. Then he tells me he's not ready for a relationship, and I understood where he was coming from, but it still hurt a bit.

 This exchange needs preservation.

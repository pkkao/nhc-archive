 Well, I'm completely sure I only have a crush on the second girl now...
 All the fiddling and the ridiculous gaps between seeing each other was too consequental, so I trust the other girl much more now.
 We will see each other again this Friday! 
 
 EDIT: Oh God Jesus Christ, I found out the first girl finally had started developing feelings for me, fuck me 
 
 But she will of course remain as a very good friend to me.

 that's a real tough break if she had just started developing feelings for you
 
 is this first girl the one you've been after for months now?
 
 
 also I think I might be getting somewhere. we were talking last night and she dropped like three hints about doing something together sometime soon
 
 eeee

 It will suck if this date for some unfortunate reason is cancelled. Let's hope not!

 Worry about them but not know how to help.

 So there's this boy I met about a month ago that I have a huge crush on. We've spent several nights together and I genuinely feel a bond with him that is greater than any bond I have felt before with a friend and sometimes it's genuinely unbearable not being with him. And recently on Facebook I noticed that he said he was going to an LGBT related event, so this probably means that he is gay or bi or something right?
 
 So I was thinking of telling that I'm gay, and I might discover that the feelings are mutual... And after all it appears that he supports LGBT people so he might at least understand.

 Go for it! If he's pro-LGBT you have nothing to lose. If he wasn't, I'd question why you bother with him.

 chick I like is having a halloween party on saturday 
 
 good news: everyone but 2 people bailed. these 2 people are male and female. therefore it's like a double date as the dude is single and the other chick just broke up with her boyfriend pretty much for this dude. fucking yay for me cause I get to spend time with the chick I like
 
 bad news: on halloween day there is a party and my mum and dad's friends house that I want to go to. unfortunately if I go to that I've gotta go to a soccer game afterwards. this means I have to arrive at the party 2 hours late WHICH IS VALUABLE TIME
 
 help me NHC, what do?

 Go to the party with two friends. You'll probably enjoy it more than the other party.
 
 Either that or bring people from the family party to the party with two friends to make that one bigger.

 nah everyone but me and my sister at the family party will be 20+ years old
 
 I will go to the friends party
 wish me luck so I don't colossally fuck it up

 I'm heading up to Leeds to see @Jarvis Cocker this weekend, clearly Halloween is the true weekend of love on the NHC.

 Three simple words: I am gay.

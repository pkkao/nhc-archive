  In the latest election Obama only barely made it, with 51 percent of the votes or so. That's what I meant when I said the chances are almost as good as Obama's win in the latest election.
 
 the joke gets more funnier the more you explain it

 My crush posted that they were getting a new IM account a week ago and to message for the new one. I've messaged "New IM?" twice so far and got nothing back. Genuinely can't tell if they're avoiding giving me the new account or didn't see the messages / forgot to reply. I have no particularly good reason to think they don't wanna keep talking to me; we were talking about meeting up someday. Wat do?

 so, the past few days I've gone on a bit of a twitter frenzy. 
 
 well yesterday I got a notification that I got a new follower and I looked her up... damn. I've seen too many instances of fake accounts in my day so I'm a bit naïve, but... she's pretty. she's only got one picture up, and unfortunately her age isn't on her account or anything like that. taking everything in me not to start up a conversation with her. what do y'all think

 like i said, I'm too paranoid on the chance it's not even whoever she says she is. she just looks pretty from that one picture she has on her profile.
 
 I've been feeling really lonely lately and am seriously considering online dating, i just don't even know where to start

 just keep faving/"liking" her stuff and then you'll eventually get married

 Downside: The conversation with the second girl was terrible and awkward.
 Upside: I'm bonding really well with the first girl again.

 I just feel like they don't really ever think of me, which means they probably don't.  I don't want anyone else. Just wanna go and live out in the sticks miles away from society because other people are increasingly getting on my tits. Don't even like my crush in the sense that I could live with them. I couldn't. I just miss having someone to spoil. What a fucked up thing to cry over.

 people pour the hearts and soul out in this thread, it's not very nice.

 I approve hamm's flippant advice and it applies as well to me as the other guy. Think we can have a sense of humour in this thread.
 
 Still haven't found the cojones to speak to my crush again. I know they're not ignoring me and we're still friends; I just have nothing to talk about. All I ever think of to say is "I miss you", even though I don't actually miss the stress of thinking I'll run into them and arranging to meet up. I just... I guess I want an opportunity to show that I've improved.

 idk if she likes me or not but she certainly ain't shy with the compliments
 
 gah whenever I start liking a girl I end up getting nervous and unable to talk to her irl
 
 ...which is awkward because I think I'm gonna be going round her place multiple times these holidays for tv marathons. curse you feelings!

 There's a girl in class I think is really cute, but I've only talked to her once, so...
 Eeeeeeeeeh.
 
 Nothing happening.
 She doesn't even come to school often, she's busy with her job.

 Clerk in an alternative store started chatting me up the other day. I got halfway home before I realised he probably thought I was eighteen and he may well be younger than that. I feel so old!
 
 After over a month of procrastinating I got my crush's new IM. They were quite short / matter of fact in their answers but I do think that's just them being them and the best I can do is demonstrate that I'm not freaking out about it. Crush recently posted about people harassing them on the internet (context clearly NOT about me) so is probably feeling tired.

 I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully. I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall be sorry for having said. I give myself away. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we walk home together from the club arm in arm, or sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain. Then I feel that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer’s day.

 Was hanging out with my 'crush' last night.  We were both really high but I've never felt more comfortable around someone before. And she really likes me, said some of the sweetest things. It's not normally like this, it doesn't seem right some how. She is kinda unofficially seeing someone who I'm friends with though which complicates things. Not really sure what to do. Not gunna screw him over but we've both acknowledged that we have some kind of spark. She's an actress and she's lovely

 I haven't seen the girl I'm slightly interested in for at least two weeks, probably more. Why doesn't she show up in school???

 The entire thing was a quote from Dorian Gray, but it's accurate, trolol.

 Funny that, I felt that it was quite 'meh', although relatable, hence I could conceivably have written it myself. Too soon to tell if I like Oscar Wilde. (This isn't a set text; it's my best friend's favourite book.)

 One of those fancy new-fangled dating sites. Fortunately he's only up in Leeds so it's a visitable distane

 I'm not sure when I'm going to start using that Clover app. I've set up a profile and everything, but I'm not sure how my parents would react to me having that app. Should probably wait until I go to a university to actually start using it.

 I always act really shy and stupid.
 
 Dosing myself on pills and starving myself usually helps combat the shyness. But that's probably a rather extreme measure for some...

 -Accidentally bump into your crush every now and then and feel convinced that they know you like them, because you keep accidentally seeing them everywhere.
 -If you see your crush but you don't speak to them, you get worried that they think you don't like them anymore or that you're ignoring them. If you do speak to them, you're worried they know you like them.

 melissa mccarthy being "fat" has nothing to do with her being unfunny

 I don't want to deny it
 
 if she was skinny, she would not have to rely on fat humour which she does all the fucking time
 her weight would also not matter if that wasn't all she relys on

 really watch a melissa mccarthy movie and you'll realize that unlike kevin james, her shtick is more like "I'M OBNOXIOUS AND AM A LOUDMOUTH"
 
 and still, even with the some of the fat jokes, there's really no reason to insult her being "fat"
 
 this is an oss-level move, mate. don't be like oss

 Damn you bias, you know it's highly illegal to criticize fat people. You can drive skinny people into suicide, but don't even think about making jokes about fat people! They have their right to get diabetes, it's their body!

 I'm not even going to address this post but this is totally something that will derail the thread so those getting their pitchforks out, please don't.

 yeah monorail don't be a dumbass
 
 apparently she isn't interested in me but you know I am a teenager so it doesn't phase me

 You're politely asking a guy you just trashed by comparing him to the lowest common denominator how he's doing?
 
 It doesn't faze you because you're a teenager? Is that sarcasm?

 No, I'm genuinely curious about your post, bias.


.. admonition:: bias (Joined Dec 2014, 6,550 posts) on 06-09-2015, 11:50 PM
 
 we teens are the "shrug it off you sick lad" generation so my post means that because she doesn't like me I'm supposed to ignore the general fact she doesn't like me
 
 else we become subject to jeering and loss of self esteem.
 
 still like her though, her eyes crinkle in a lovely way when you make her laugh really hard and her eyes in general are pre good

 Damn, I wish I was able to let go of stuff that easily. You must be a really happy person.

 is that a bad thing or
 
 I get let down a lot
 main reason why I haven't asked her out and missed my window I think
 fear of rejection

  Should I actually buy her a Valentine's Gift though? I have my doubts.
 
 Just do it man. The sooner you act, the better. If you keep holding back, building a massive crush it will be eventually harder to approch her since you overanalyse and have doubts about everything (like you seem to have already) and if she happens to turn you down it's gonna hurt you alot more than it would right now.
 
 Valentine's day is coming, perfect time to ask her out. Honestly it would be a win for you in either way, either you get a date or you can move on and a new girl will cross your path some day.

 this has got to be one of the funniest threads I've ever read. No offence, Snospitmmer (why the hell does your name keep changing?) but the NHC are really goddamn snarky. Nearly woke up the house again. 
 
 Well, it's nearly as funny as the original Roast topic.

 my favorite part is still when OSS asked her if it was cool to add her on facebook

 my fav part is that OSS finds it 'cute' that she did a class presentation like a normal student would

 OSS is also a fan of rape humor, at least to some extent. Coincidence? I think SNOTpimmer.
 
 Edit: even though it's snospitmmer my point still stands

 - Bug them for hours for no real reason and with nothing to say.
 - End up admitting to that.
 - Feel bad during the lulls but just love their company so much.
 - Back out way later than would be recommended, but know that I'm slowly wearing them down in terms of "How could you possibly feel stupid around me? I'm KING STUPID!! Whatever you're thinking, just go for it!"
 - Wonder if I will ever learn their kinks...

 ask for a picture of them and when they say no call them a stuck up bitch

 -Send them a message that you think is a really great idea at the time
 -Suddenly regret it a minute later and worry that they think you're psychotic

 So there was this girl i liked back in elementary school back in 1st grade. I obviously didn't tell her because no boy wants to do that at that age. She moved at one point which was a crushing blow as I never got to say goodbye. We got in touch about 7 years later (about 2007) and have been in touch since. I'be always wanted to tell her I liked her, but I think it would be weird to do it on facebook. I'm half-way always the state from her and I don't know her number. Does anyone know How I would start a conversation with her and then just tell her? I know it's a weird question, but I just don't know how to start it out.

 ^ If I were you, I'd just say something else nice and work up to it. "I've always liked you" is a bit moot if they aren't even gonna take "I like what you've done to your hair" well. Personality compliments are always good, but be aware that some girls will assume there just isn't anything good about them physically if you compliment their brains, so tread carefully. Maybe make it relevant to something she's done deliberately e.g. I've no qualms telling Creature that his new piercing is sexy because it's NEW, and not like I've just sat on that compliment for a decade.

 Can I just say by the way that my second favorite thing about this thread is @#Halloween randomly coming in and actually talking about the thread topic here and there?

 @Snospitmmer SimpEhtson Why, thank you. That's one of the kindest out-of-nowhere comments I've had on a forum.

 Okay, I told and she took it very well and thought it was cute. Now I feel silly for being nervous all those years. I did work up to it like you said by starting with school. Thank you for the advice.

 I don't know why I keep having the recurring thought when alone that it must be hard not to sexually assault people when in person it is SO FAR FROM MY MIND. Think it's just OCD. I would never do that. I just don't fully understand how I don't get the urge to do something terrible when what I want to do is so far from what I actually do. I just never feel like that. So does that mean it's not a feeling people generally have? For the longest time, I thought that most people actually had to actively repress the urge to rape someone, but for me it's just like... no, I respect you too much to lay a finger on you. I respect ALL people that much. And I'd get negative, as in less than zero, pleasure out of hurting another person. Who the fuck wouldn't feel the same way? I'm drunk. Basically I think I've disproven MRAs when actually all I've done is hang out with my crush and not want to rape him. As Chris Rock would say, "That's what you're SUPPOSED to do! What do you want, a medal?"

 Okay, now I definitely know why I didn't post this before.

 Creepier than the time he sent her this video?

 Engage them in a three hour long conversation about everything under the sun. Admit to being fur-curious just for some common ground. Smile myself to sleep. Smile myself awake. Smile. Smile. Smile.

 Having your first crush on someone the same sex as you is really great and shit at the same time. Really great because you have your first crush but shit because they're probably straight and you have to keep it a secret from them and you get all disappointed because you were hoping they weren't straight. And then after that they're just a normal friend and it's meh.

 Panther posting the picture of her was un-cool, oldschoolersimpson posting pictures of her is un-cool, I get that it could be facebook and it may not be illegal, but what do you seriously think she would say if you asked her about it?

 Hey, I'll delete it sooner or later, I just felt like sharing with you how a girl I'm interested in looks like, is that so wrong?

 BOUN.DA.RIES. I'd feel angry, violated, and creeped out if someone did that to me. Showing your IRL friends a picture she publicly posted is one thing, posting her pic to a message board full of strangers is quite another.

 I like that OSS has to get spanked in order to learn a "lesson"

 Why did you wait for weeks before telling me how horrible and awful my actions were?

 No one said anything near as strong as horrible or awful don't be a drama queen.

 Use imgur instead.

 Well that joke backfired massively.

 Oh.
 
 It'd probably work better if you posted one broken photo instead of two.

 @mutilated_lips Can you just remove the image from your comment? I already deleted my picture before, in case some inconvenience would occur.

 Wish for a valid reason to speak to them.
 
 Wish for the reasons to stop coming because I don't want to be annoying.

 I've deleted the picture from the quote for you, mainly because I find it creepy that it was posted in the first place. Do we really need to be sharing images of irl people without them knowing?

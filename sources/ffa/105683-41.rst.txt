 The situation is killing me guys. I'm falling hard for this girl and I know she's not in a state to commit. Ideally I'd put some distance between us but I know that she really needs my support at the moment. It's making me so so depressed. Any advice would be amazing.

 the only place i can talk about things is in a forum of a tv show, on which I'm the most reviled poster. so isolated, becoming dependant on someone who (unintentionally) makes me sad. sorry for the self indulgence, should probably start a journal instead of posting in this thread

 You could always just try your hardest to put the romance stuff on the back burner and just support her as a friend for now. Support goes a long way, as kes alluded to earlier in regards to being with someone who is depressed. As someone who was also in such a situation for bit, stress and depression can weigh far too heavily on one and simply skew what they need and want as well as any possibly feelings for another.

 That's what I want to do but it's not easy to detach myself. Like when I saw her tonight I made sure nothing happened. In the end she went off to have a drink with this other guy that she likes. And it's hard for that not to hurt.

 Yeah, I'm sure that isn't at all fun to experience, but unfortunately unless you make it clear how you feel, you can't force her to stop doing things with people other than you.

 I was referring to the relationship, but the depression could fit too. Never being in a relationship is the major cause of my depression.

 Ugh, how do I learn patience? I've had a horrible two days and deliberately not exposed this person to it because decency (and they'd do the same) but I've been so stressed and all I want is to be like "Internet cuddle?" Also it's really hard not being able to gauge whether they're just uninterested in me or life itself. The latter is incredibly likely. Possibly both. I would definitely not like to be with someone who acted any more interested than this though. I am very solitary and easily fatigued. Sometimes when I arrange to do something with somebody, it turns out I'm really not up for it and then I'm terrible company. I just miss living near this person because it was nice being able to decide on the day.

 I realised that the only thing I can do to talk to people is either "do you want to go to the bar" or do you want to play *insert videogame"... I need more social outlets. (and online videogames are banned here and we live quite far from each other, so  )

 Friend I was messaging on fb just text me asking if he can be completely honest about something and immediately sent "Nope no worries forget I said anything".
 
 He blatantly wants to be with me. I really like him but not that way and also I live counties away but I just don't want a relationship and if there's one thing that makes me back away slowly it's someone actually being interested. Well, it's that or he's coming out as a paedophile. Either is equally plausible given that he seems never to date anyone over 18 and he's like 33.

 That doesn't make him a pedophile, a pederast at worst.

 It's when you at an old age are attracted to girls it technically is legal to have sex with, but they are still way, way too young. 
 
 For example: a 50-year-old going for someone who's 17.

 Pederasty or paederasty (US /ˈpɛdəræsti/ or UK /ˈpiːdəræsti/) is a (usually erotic) homosexual relationship between an adult male and a pubescent or adolescent male.

 *ephebophile. I think paedophile is okay colloquially in the context of an unidentified person I'm pissed off with.
 
 Also given how many posts are by me, technically this thread is autistic.

 Insomnia has started insulting autistic people a whole lot lately. I don't know what the hell for.

 It's not to insult autistic people it basically means annoying.

 i'm sure insomnia hasn't got anything against autistic people.

 He's using it as a derogatory term, though. I'm tired of discrimination against people with autism. We've achieved women's rights, we've achieved blacks' rights, we've achieved LGBT rights, but we haven't achieved autistic rights. That needs to change, and it needs to begin with getting people to stop using "autistic" as an insult.

 we actually haven't really achieved any of those

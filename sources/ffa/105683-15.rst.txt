 OSS you've outed yourself as a beta once again. if she wants to see it you fucking see it, because fifty shades is just fodder for chicks to get horny, thus leading to sexual activities.

 Pretty cool. Maybe it's just because Swedish is a cool language and everything in Swedish is cool, but good job OSS.

 FINALLY Oss is going on that date. Good for you. Now close the deal. Just have fun.
 
 Kupo is probably the best judge on whether the card would be adorable to receive. Maybe some other girls can chip in. If I had to give a suggestion, I'd say when you draw someone, always look if you've drawn elements elegant enough. Since a drawing is a kind of mirror, some people can be very sensitive to that stuff. So yeah, fix the lumpy space boobs a bit. Good luck

 Don't worry, he's one step closer to his study material right now. Once he's had a pair of real boobs in front of him and in his hands, he'll know.

 I showed her the card today (I didn't know where I'd print it out in full color, so I just did it in the chat) and she loved it. She didn't say "Cute, but I just want to stay friends or anything", she was just happy over the card I gave her. It was great timing too, since she had worked with handing out commercial flyers, and since she hates her job, she wasn't feeling well. So I cheered her up.

 Are you telling me that all this time, if I wanted to get a date, all I had to do is make the girl a card on MS paint?

 Hahaha 
 Well, we have known each other since about late August/September after all, so I definitely wouldn't have made the card if I hadn't been in love with her so long and wasn't sure if there would be no risks. Sure I could have fucked up like I've done with earlier crushes, but this time I really tried the hardest not to.

 Hey, nothing is impossible! As long as you just give up on Martha, she doesn't seem to want to take it further in any way.

 I  don't see her anymore, since we aren't in any classes together. I did run into her in the hall recently, but she was in a hurry, so we could only exchange greetings and quick pleasantries.

 I have a question: If I want a girlfriend, am I required to know how to do the flirting thing? Because I just read this, and if I have to know how to do all that, I'm never getting one.

 Girl: I love thongs.
 Guy: I'll bet you look great in a thong.
 
 Ugh. There's no mystery there; no challenge. By being direct and obvious, this guy's robbed this exchange of all its fun. Here's the flirtatious man's more subtle response:
 
     Girl: I love thongs.
     Guy: Thongs do have a very nice way of accenting the female form.
 
 And another take on a reply using subtlety in response to the same statement:
 
     Girl: I love thongs.
     Guy: Oh really? Well, believe it or not, I love girls who love thongs.
 			
 		
 
 I'm dying

 yeah that makes a lot more sense dude thank you : )
 thing is tho, she doesn't really talk much about issues. like she won't talk to me about some stuff which sucks because sometimes i just wanna know what i've done to make her sad or pissed off

 Guys I feel like a such a prick.
 
 Went to visit a friend at uni and ended up kissing her. We were both sleeping in her bed but it was totally platonic and just nice. And then for no real reason I decided to make a move. We'd dated briefly ages ago, so there was some history, but we've just been real close friends for a long while. It wasn't horrendously awkward or anything but I feel like I comprised that platonic niceness we had. 
 
 She's had a couple of 'friends' use her before and now I feel like I'm one of them. She sort of seeing someone too, though they're not exclusive, so I also feel like dick on that front . I messaged her today about how bad I feel and she doesn't seem fussed, but it must have changed how she perceives me. Which really sucks because she's one of my best friends.

 i dunna apolo, if u kissed and were in the same bed "making the move" would be like..normal behaviour? it doesn't sound totally platonic really.
  @noodlesoup, i know what u mean. just tell her then give her some time to think about it and back off for a bit so you don't appear too clingy. you don't need to get down on one knee over liking her, just say and that should be enough

 Sacrificing a platonic relationship for a potential romantic one is never not scary. If she's seeing someone but it's not serious then don't let yourself get too worked up about it. The question here is do you like this girl enough to ultimately let things go beyond where they're at? She says she's had guy friends use her but what if you could break the cycle and be the guy friend who actually wants to be with her? You said you guys dated briefly in the past so it's not like you guys aren't knowingly attracted to each other, why did it end?
 
 Talk to her in person about this @Hanukkah-Apologist. You may as well find out how she feels about all this rather than trying to just ignore what happened. If you guys are as close of friends as you say you are, this is something that you should be able to talk about with a decent level of understanding regardless of whether or not you both feel the same way.

 @noodlesoup don't date someone who you know is manipulative. Besides the obvious reason that they will try to manipulate you, it's a pretty shitty thing to be able to say about your SO: "Yeah, they're my SO, but they're also manipulative".

 I don't think I could date her again tbh, our dynamic really has changed so much since then. 
 
 I just wish I hadn't put myself into this slightly awkward and ambiguous middle-ground. We should have either had a casual one-night stand or just spooned. Now I feel bad for making an initial move (if she didn't want anything to happen) and bad for not trying to take it further (if she did want something to happen). 
 
 In related news, I've returned to Tinder.

 Apolo, how exactly did she react in the moment when you kissed her?


.. admonition:: skully the poltergeist (Joined Mar 2015, 2,479 posts) on 11-19-2016, 03:19 PM
 
 Well she kissed back but it wasn't like it used to be. There was a real passiveness.
 
 Tbh I think she probably would have slept with me if I'd carried on but I'm not sure it would have been for the right reasons. She's told me, that because she's going through a rough time atm, shes had sex with guys despite not really feeling it. And there's been a couple of 'friends' that she thinks have taken advantage of her. 
 
 I'm worried that she'll now think I'm one of those 'friends' who are really just out to get with her. Which isn't the case because I care about her a lot.

 Jesus... this is a little outside my area of expertise but uh... maybe the fact that you backed off and apologized was a good move in that case. This really seems like something you should sit down and talk about with her though. If you're her best friend, maybe that's what she needs you to be now more than ever.

 she was flirting heavily with me on friday and we were having a good talk and she introduced me to one of her friends from ireland
 then yesterday morning we had another fight because she didn't understand why people were so frustrated with her. something along the lines of "i get that i'm annoying but what have i done lately"
 i didn't really know what to say to that so i didn't reply and then she said "why ignore" to which i replied "im at work right now" to which she replied "but you were talking to me just fine before"
 in the end i said to her that i need to get back to work so she got mad and hasn't talked to me since
 
 i also thought i'd bring up something with you guys cus you're smarter than me
 she has a friend from denmark called mads who she's talked to for 6 years. in the past she's told me all this weird shit they've done together over the internet but on friday i think it crossed a line
 i asked her how she was getting to school that day cus our siblings were graduating and i wanted to know if she was going with her family or on the bus
 she told be she was going on the bus and then she said that this mads guy was tracking her location 
 i was like wtf that's weird as and she didn't talk to me till friday afternoon 
 
 is it weird that he did that? idk i think it is

 1. All this teen drama shit sure makes me not miss being a teen.
 2. Tracking a person's location is pretty weird. Stalker stuff, really.
 
 Honestly this girl sounds like she isn't worth the trouble in the slightest.

 yeah i'm kinda agreeing with you there hahah
 i hung out with a couple of girls last night who were pretty cool. one sings and is really hot. the other has a mad taste in music and is really cool
 idk tho i'm not really the best at flirting


.. admonition:: Torrens (Joined Feb 2015, 1,043 posts) on 11-19-2016, 04:41 PM
 
 Don't flirt, just be a normal dude and get to know them before putting any moves on 'em.

 Yeah, I know the whole "Be yourself" thing seems like bullshit but it's honestly the best course of action.

 pls : (
 it can't be helped that some of the best looking girls at my school are named ella but it is a pleasant coincidence

 That reminds me of my high school years. There was a popular Mormon girl named Elena who most guys had a thing for, due to her being "forbidden fruit" (she was unable to date per the church for most of HS)... she was nice but I did not share the same weird affection as others. Still, my mom was convinced I had a crush on her, hilariously so. She would always accuse me of it and I would shoot back confused looks. 
 
 Eventually my actual crush came into focus with them when I started my hopeless and pathetic attempt to win her heart, but even still my parents thought it was a cover to not show that I was infatuated with Elena.
 
 I'm friends with her on Facebook. She's currently married and helped make America great again (complete with admonishing protests, hooray) so my mom should be glad that she was wrong all those years.

 Man, even I think that Ella (the first one) just doesn't sound worth wasting time with. Go for the singer Ella, noodle.
 
 Anyway, the reason I'm updating this thread is... You know when someone jokingly says about you and another friend "You two would make a good couple"? Well, it happened today and I laughed at it then, but... now I don't really find it funny  This is a girl I used to have a massive crush on.
 
 It's just a huge stop for me now. I asked someone at my job if she wanted to do something, but now we haven't spoken anything more about it in two weeks. And as for the dating sites... Man, I don't even check Tinder now. Fuck that site.

 was the joke to do with sound?
 i didn't even think he was making a joke i thought he was being genuinely serious
 
 ill call singer ella sella from now on and the ella i dated will be called ella for simplicity 
 
 anyway ella is rly annoyin me cus she watched a movie on the weekend and won't tell me what it's called : (
 i spoke to sella today and nothing was awkward. she's actually really pretty now that i'm paying attention to her :^)

 Yeah man, almost asked her out about a year or two back but foolishly got back with an ex instead. 
 
 Pretty unexpected message to get tbh. Only problem is that I spend half my time in Scotland these days. But yeah, going for a drink later this month.

 That doesn't sound like you screwing up. just her not being interested I guess.

 Relax. I mean if she anwers "I don't know" then maybe she doesn't know? It's not like all girls are superbeings who are always sure of what they want. Take it easy, dude.

 Seeing as 75%of panther's posts I've ever seen in off topic have been about girls, or his masturbation marathons, i never considered he'd by bisexual.

 He's posted about his bisexuality before.

 oh behave handy, you've posted worse than that before 
 
 genuinely shocked about panther though, he has that inbetweeners vibe about him, its weird. Like OSS coming out would be. I thought panther left the S off on he, still shocked tbh

 So does this mean Mr Black is not actually a woman who left the s off of mrs? Now I'm shocked

 I honestly hope your're taking the most contrary position on purpose for a laugh. Asking someone if they were meeting a "he" isn't homophobic. It is expressing surprise. Any judgement of mine is entirely whatever you read into it. Maybe you've been conditioned to automatically read judgement into things but there was nothing there.

 painty can ned, I blocked you a while ago, so you might as well give up trying to create controversy or paint me as some rape loving, gay hating white supremacist. I know you love confrontations like these and only ever post when one occurs but I think you should give up. haven't got time for you after your lies and shit you posted about me.

 I think you might have stumped them with that one

 Why do we need vast lists of posts before we say hey you're being homophobic?

 probably because asking someone if they are bisexual/gay doesn't equate to homophobia. Sorry you don't understand


.. admonition:: Nwordpassforsale (Joined Feb 2010, 2,651 posts) on 02-08-2016, 02:04 PM
 
 I never even accused them of being homophobic. You weren't just asking them if they were bisexual. You were acting like someone being bisexual is such a crazy thing that you couldn't believe

 i don't know if it was meant to be homophobic but it really does lean that way, certainly the question could've been worded better.
 
 also i agree that it doesn't matter what other homophobic posts he may or may not have made in the past if we are talking about the post he made a few hours ago, especially since no one even said that he's posted homophobic material in the past.  i have seen several rather ignorant posts by goodfella(the most immediate one i can think of is in that recent vegetarian thread), but i can't say i've seen anything homophobic posted by him before.  still don't think it matters that much in regards to this specific situation though.

 Yeah this is the real issue, because that's exactly how it came off.
 
 At this point, it'd just be great/nice if "really?" and similar can stop being the reaction to people's sexual orientation after having assumed (should not do this) otherwise.

 Context context context 
 
 panther to me was your typical hetro teenage/yearly twenties guy, a bit like OSS. The idea of him meeting a guy WAS crazy. However I have now fully processed the news and recent development RE his sexuality. I will now get on with my life and
 
 EDIT: vegetarian thread? I don't even know this one but maybe this will be the next topic for my outspoken blog to cover...

 this shit, even called you out on it.  your other post in the thread isn't any better, even if there is a little bit of tongue in cheek going on in it.

 The only instance where I've gone "What? Really?" is when I was told kupomog and Shaunbadia were a couple.

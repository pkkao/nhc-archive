 You can't let rejection break you down. Believe me, I've been rejected tons of times. But because I never gave up, I finally got a date.

 I feel like I am harassing them if they say no and I keep pushing

 Yeah. And apparently there are these girls who play "hard to get" and want you to keep asking them. Like...how am I supposed to know what you're doing?

 most girls who aren't idiots don't play "hard to get"

 I don't get it either, @handsome. You shouldn't just give up once you've been rejected. What's wrong with what he's doing?

 well some MISCOMMUNICATION occurred there. but the 'psycho' post is still certainly well-deserved

 Either way, right now is the worst day of my life.

 just tell the good people at NHC what happened instead of pointlessly cursing and sulking because otherwise no one on here can sympathize or care to talk to you about it

 Okay.
 Today, she noticed how flirty I was acting against her (which is weird since I've been flirty five million fucking times) and when asking why I was flirting with her... I really wanted to lie. Believe me, I really wanted to fucking lie. But I couldn't. She found out I'm in love with her.
 "Eh, not that bad" you might think. No?
 She then said "someone else is in her heart" (she's not technically together with anyone yet, but it's bad enough). She tried to comfort me all she could, but every attempt was useless and I just started feeling worse and worse instead. When a crush says to me "Believe me, someday you will find someone" just feels like a giant fuck you. THAT'S WHAT EVERY FUCKING PREVIOUS CRUSH HAS SAID TO ME! So when I have to hear it one more time, I just become... furious. When the hell is that "day"? Why is it so hard to find someone who doesn't fuckin' reject? Why am I always so goddamn non-important? I'm just a measly ant. I mean nothing. Doesn't matter how nice I am and how hard I try, I'm still just a fucking ant. So now, instead of watching the rest of the movie I started, I'm just sitting in the dark crying. What a great fuckin' life, amIright?
 Fuck everything.

 I only ever had one date with her, which went great even though it was a little awkward.
 Yes, it was this girl.

 you just have to face facts that she probably doesn't like you. obviously i can't say this is completely accurate from your one-sided posts but it seems pretty clear to me. it is certainly really hard to find someone, but not impossible. you just need the determination and willpower. also (some) self-loathing helps a li'l bit i find

 It's not that she doesn't like me, she's just not interested in me.
 
 I loathe myself like hell sometimes, but how on earth has that ever helped me?

 it helps in the sense that you can stop and say to yourself you're not the WORLD'S GREATEST SEX MACHINE. the only person that can really say that and mean it is hutz

 I've mentioned it on here before. I was in a play, and it was being critiqued by people who were determining if we were good enough to perform at the state conference. It was near the end of the play, and I was walking stage right to confront somebody. I started feeling odd and knew that imminent doom awaited. I started having a simple partial seizure and was unable to say my lines. I mumbled and made little sounds, and the person I confronted had to make up something on the spot. It was obvious to the entire audience that I forgot my lines, except I didn't forget them—I was simply unable to say them. After the play, I just went in the dressing room and cried because of how embarrassed I was and how sure I was that I had cost us a chance at performing at the state conference. Luckily, my dad was eventually able to get in touch with the people who were judging the show and explain it to them, and after a few agonizing weeks, we learned we made it to state. So it had a happy ending, but it haunts me to this day.

 Have I ever said that? I've only said that Shaft is.
 I'm not even close to that. I'm not even a chick magnet. I'm just a stupid fucking loser who witnesses how people get their lives back on track or hooks up with other chicks (or guys) like bread and butter while I just keep having it worse.
 Now tell me how I'm not loathing myself enough?

 I'm just giving general shitty advice. in fact you might want to tone down on the loathing a bit

 OSS you are a good looking young white male and you are also a teenager. There will be far worse days. I'm sorry she rejected you, but uh try to calm down I guess.
 
 At the very least, can you just please not be like all those other assholes who cry friendzone and then dump your friend because she's not worth talking anymore to if she's not a love interest? 'cause it's super rotten.

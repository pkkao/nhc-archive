 Well, I've been on a dating site (yes, believe it or not) for a few days now and... MEH. It's a seriously frustrating experience. I've looked at plenty of profiles and tried messaging about 4 others when one didn't answer even when online. We'll see how it goes I guess, but I really hate doing this. The previous experience I had with a dating site was terrible (someone had masked on a fake identity and it was close that I took the train to another city and met a complete stranger, someone I had no clue about).

 Wasn't me. Handsome? Torm?
 
 Anyway, are there only 4 people that seem interesting to you? Because you're gonna have to message more than that. And even then, most likely just a percentage of the answers will lead to a date.

 No, I've messaged 5. But there are only about 20 matches showing up (there really never are many new ones), and one of them had BDSM as "one of 6 things she could not live without". Which means... not my type at all.

 What the... Somebody just answered! Hahaha.

 You can't picture yourself being a master nor a slave?
 
 What dating site has only 20 matches?

 Absolutely not a master at least. I would feel like a fucking rapist (really no offense Spruce, I know you are into this stuff).

 Well what did she message back?


.. admonition:: OldSchoolerSimpsons (Joined Aug 2013, 15,333 posts) on 02-11-2016, 02:12 PM
 
 "Haha hello!"
 
 (I did come off as kind of nervous in my message, probably hence the "Haha")

 if people can sense the nervousness in your TEXT then there might be a problem here

 I'm just speculating, I did try to be as chill as possible.

 There's a girl who works on the school newspaper with me whom I've gotten along with really well, and yesterday I realized why: she has Asperger's too. Her Facebook shows that she's single, so next time I see her, I might say, "Hi! I notice you're single! So am I! Want to get lunch sometime?" We Aspies need people to be direct, so I think it could work really well.

 I'd suggest editing it to
 
 and perhaps acknowledge that you feel like you're getting along really well. Go for it!

 Yeah, I'm an aspie and I'd still find "I notice you're single - so am I!" a bit of a turn off and would also never say it. Definitely ask her to get lunch!

 Oh, all right. Thanks for the heads-up.

 The luncheon has been scheduled for Monday at 11:00!

 A gir I've been getting advice from said I should have subtly mentioned it was a date. She memtioned that I should've said "It's a date" after she agreed to the lunch.

 I think it should be fine even if you weren't explicit this particular time. The date is set so y'all can just have a nice lunch together without any expectations or assumptions.

 Just take your time. Enjoy a fun hour or so of lunch. If you feel like you're hitting it off, set a new 'official' longer date at the end of it. Maybe the following saturday.


.. admonition:: OldSchoolerSimpsons (Joined Aug 2013, 15,333 posts) on 02-13-2016, 02:52 AM
 
 Bravissomo, Panther. I'm hoping this date/lunch/dalunche works out for you!   Never give up, dude.
 
 The girl I wrote to has now replied again. Thankfully I was restrained enough that I didn't write "Where did you go?" or "Hello?" before she wrote back again. I guess that's an acheivement on my part.
 We are messaging each other right now, in fact.

 I had lunch with her and it went really well, but I casually brought up the question of if she'd ever had a boyfriend, and she said she had one, but she's too busy to have a boyfriend at the moment. I guess we'll just stay friends then.


.. admonition:: OldSchoolerSimpsons (Joined Aug 2013, 15,333 posts) on 02-15-2016, 12:50 PM
 
 Sigh.
 
 It's been 2 days since we last spoke, have yet to receive another message. I feel tempted to ask if she's busy or something in that style, but knowing it's no use I haven't bothered with that.
 Maybe she's got a lot to do (she's working for Samsung), that's pretty much my guess.

 I have no problem with either actor, but I'd probably have trouble trying to give a shit about the budding romance of fat Van Wilder and the Sidney Prescott parody from Scary Movie. Sometimes it's just hard to detach certain actors from previous roles. I mean, Ryan Reynolds has basically just been Van Wilder to me right up until I saw Deadpool, and I've yet to see something with Anna Faris that makes me see her as anything other than Cindy Campbell.

 Haha, I wasn't totally serious with that post. Well, yes the movie is bad but yes I would totally watch the two of them read a packet of microwave soup.
 
 Watch Anna Faris in May.

 Learnt some deep shit about them this week. Nothing I wasn't expecting, mind. Now they're having a bad time and I'm feeling all the feelings and I just wanna go hold 'em tight. Take 'em away from all that noise. But I can't. Fucking internet relationships.

 A week! I swear to God, there has been a whole week since we last spoke!
 Is this normal? Am I worried for a reason or is still possible she's just very busy? Because 3 days, that's fine. That's pretty excusable. But a week is really stretching it, I'm worried she will never write back again.


.. admonition:: kupomog (Joined Feb 2002, 37,972 posts) on 02-19-2016, 11:02 AM
 
 Yeah, it's normal for people who have no obligation to speak to each other to not speak for a week.


.. admonition:: OldSchoolerSimpsons (Joined Aug 2013, 15,333 posts) on 02-19-2016, 11:10 AM
 
 But I don't understand, she seemed interested in talking to me! I wrote to her and she replied invitingly. And our conversation went well, but then she just disappeared.


.. admonition:: kupomog (Joined Feb 2002, 37,972 posts) on 02-19-2016, 11:15 AM
 
 She seemed interested to you but maybe she found that she wasn't after all. Maybe she chickened out, maybe she's too nice to say otherwise she doesn't want to talk. Maybe she's busy. Maybe she just doesn't know what to say. This kind of stuff happens a lot online because it can. And people really do just get cold feet and stop messaging or, as seen earlier, they straight up do not show up to invites. This has happened to me before.
 
 There are a lot of maybes and you'll never know what it is unless she decides she wants to say. It's not fair, but you have to respect people, of course. Best not to dwell on why and just continue on messaging/finding others to talk to and click with.

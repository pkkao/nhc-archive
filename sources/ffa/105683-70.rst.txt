 @Torrens People are so creepy! One of my friends (who I did subsequently fuck, but this comment freaks me out and always will) responded to me saying I'm coming over bc the neighbours are shagging loudly and I don't feel confrontational today, with something along the lines of "Cool. I'll be at yours, beating off with my ear against the wall." Why u gotta be so...? They obviously think it's funny, but given I'm a student warden and want absolutely nothing to do with clients' sex lives, he shoulda known that would sicken me. (We're 23; they're 18.) He followed that up by saying that all men would do this and I'm the weird one.

 Eww no. It might be something a high schooler would say, and perhaps men who haven't grown up, but being a man myself I think of sex last. I honestly don't like to listen to people doing it, and having lived on campus, it happens a lot.
 
 Anyway, I'm sometimes frustrated, but it isn't sexual. It's really just loneliness.

  Unrelated, what I came in here to post: are men on the whole just more sexually frustrated and lonely than women? Is this because your friends don't cuddle you or tell you that you look nice? Because, like, I doubt masturbating is harder for you than it is for me. I simply cannot imagine being so bitter - especially not outside the context of a significant individual. I must find out, o' forum, if this is really a thing?
 
 Eh, I've been used to straight male friends hugging me and asking for opinions on clothes/hair frequently enough from about the age of 16 (The latter never has to be anything specific, just a general "Hey, do I look okay?"). I guess I'm just lucky to have a close circle of friends who don't give a fuck about being perceived as "faggy" or whatever homophobic term someone might be inclined to fire out there to describe it just because they're not willing to be completely emotionless.
 
 That said, the guys in the world who are bitter for seemingly no other reason than a mixture of blue balls and loneliness do seem to be at least partly affected by toxic masculinity in the sense that they don't feel secure enough to let their guard down and communicate like well adjusted human beings with their friends, family or potential partners leading to them bottling up their emotions until they fester and eventually come out in very unsettling ways. That's not an excuse for it either, because eventually you've gotta grow the fuck up and accept responsibility for your own shortcomings, aim to be a better person, treat others with a bit of respect and stop acting so fucking entitled, but a lot of people don't which leads us to situations that we see all too often where women feel unsafe or uncomfortable by these miserable dicks.
 
 I'm sure in some cases it's not even about the sexual frustration (Because yeah, it's not like jerking off takes much effort) so much as it is the troublesome perspective of seeing women as a conquest or a social status thing. That not having a girlfriend or having failed to fuck a significant number of women by a certain point in your life makes you a failure as a man. The more you maintain those shitty attitudes yet see no positive result for it the further you sink into a resentment of the opposite sex if you're incapable of admitting that your own approach to the whole thing is wrong because you've been raised with toxic ideas of what it means to be a man and can't possibly begin to accept that stuff you've been raised to believe is bullshit, especially when you have your perspective of things further warped by other assholes with similar attitudes towards women who somehow do manage to get together with someone be it a relationship or a casual fuck.
 
 Now, obviously you have your dudebro types who often exude these emotionless, misogynistic and homophobic ways of behaving on a more open and outward level be they successful in doing so or not but then you also have the more reserved, passive aggressive "Nice Guys". The weaselly little bastards who can't understand why women aren't interested in them in spite of what a nice guy they are, even though their ulterior motives for being nice in the first place are what make them so fucking off-putting along with the inevitable fallout where they bitch and moan about being stuck in the fucking friend zone. 
 
 TL;DR there are many contributing factors to why men act bitter and shitty towards women, but almost all of them can be linked back to toxic ideas of masculinity.

 @PATRICK WILSON Same quote, and I just wanted to say I like your attitude.

 @Shaunbadia: totally agree with both your posts. The thing about the guys you mentioned is that I think a lot of them confuse sex with love and affection. Deep down they want love and affection but they are confusing that genuine emotional need with the desire for sex, and thereby thinking sex is a need. It also doesn't help that probably a lot of them are/were emotionally stunted and have the maturity levels of pre-teens, or at best, teenagers, and so they get angry and petulant and lash out like a child/teenager would because of what they think women/society are "denying" them. (That's not even really a slam because I think I was pretty emotionally stunted myself a few years back, tbh, but not to their extent.)
 
 I'm not even gonna say they're spoiled brats because I think if you looked at the history of a lot of those type of guys, you would see a lot of abuse and emotional neglect, probably from authority figures. So many people are fucked over by their parents/guardians, but then they grow up and turn that toxicity back onto others.

 BINGO. My second boyfriend had an abusive single mother, and although he craved the type of affection I gave him (which was the only affection he got from anyone which was consistent and unconditional), he would shut me out of his life for being frigid and various other silly reasons, like somehow he was getting more validation from sex with a girl who had significant MH issues (not a knock; I have them too) and who he insisted made his life a misery. Don't start me on the similarities between his girlfriends and his mother, and how he seemed to enjoy how "crazy" the GF was! But basically, genuine platonic or romantic affection wasn't good enough. I'll never forget how that made me feel, because I knew what he needed, and it wasn't what he wanted, or so he liked everyone to think. I don't know if this makes sense. It was so fucking complicated.

 @Uncle Kester, I hope your (ex?) BF got the mental healthcare help he needed. The love you gave him would never have been enough because it sounds like he was basically a black hole for it and also wanted something approximating the abuse he'd known from his mother.  It's sad to see someone you care about stuck in an emotional rut like that. But no one can pull them out of it except themselves.

 It's always super upsetting to me to read about people being given all this love and affection by their SO and just... throwing it away like that. Like, that sort of thing is just so, so precious to me and honestly, if I didn't have @Dialing [M For Murder] Politely in my life providing that I dunno how the fuck I'd cope because most days it's all that keeps me sane and I can't begin to express how goddamn grateful I am for that. Being able to reciprocate that love and knowing that someone out there cares about me the same way I care about them and that I can make the same kind of difference in their life that they do to mine is just... it's really wonderful.
 
 tl;dr I'm just a big sappy S.O.B. who lives for love

 @Torrens I think it'll be a slow road for him for various reasons, but he seems happy enough in himself. Neither of my exes seem to hold down a relationship too great, if I'm honest. I'd be surprised if the other guy has been with anyone longer than he was with me by now and we're in our twenties. The guy with the scary mother may have a sorta love renaissance when he's much older - my stepfather has, and while he's still somewhat abusive, shows it's never too late I guess.
 
 I could see @Shaunbadia moon over @Dialing [M For Murder] Politely all day and never get sick of it. Adorable.

 I try not to because I can't help but feel like when I do people on the board are probably thinking "Ugh, not this shit again" but sometimes I can't help unloading a bunch of lovey dovey stuff.
 
 She's currently visiting her granny out of town (Who doesn't have internet) for a few days and while that might not seem like a big deal or anything it just feels weird not having consistent contact other than a few minutes on the phone via Skype per night (Don't wanna go using up all her data). Especially when we're used to sleeping together on cam most nights and leaving calls running for as long as possible before either Skype or one of our internet connections shits itself. Hence a little bit of the usual gushing over each other that's usually reserved for private conversations is spilling into this thread on my part while she's away.
 
 I am a needy sort.   Luckily we both admit to being that way so it actually works to our mutual benefit rather than one side feeling smothered by the other.

 Awwwww. Anyone who doesn't see long distance relationships working as giving them hope is a bitter bastard anyway!
 
 Needy is an interesting way to put it. I felt smothered in a relationship once, and heck, I thought I was fairly needy. Maybe there's a difference between needy for long distance contact like IM and forum quotes, and needy for actual physical contact which frankly I hate. The other night I had sex with my friend - nothing weird about that - but threw away my water bottle because I gave him a sip!

 @Shaunbadia you've heard of the Reddit incels/trucels thing, yes? That's easily the most fucked up and vile outcome of uber-toxic masculinity, and is almost terrifying to know some are out there with these horrific beliefs. (extreme TW to those who may want to check it out)

 I actually was not aware of this @Ryan because the closest I'll get to Reddit most of the time is Imgur and even that's just a soapbox for "I'm not a racist/homophobe/transphobe etc. BUT..." types to jerk each other off and act like they're being quirky about it with stupid Confession Bear and Unpopular Opinion Puffin memes. Had to get the lowdown from r/OutOfTheLoop just now. I had heard the term "Involuntary Celibate" used before but uh.... can't find the Trucel thing. Seems as though it was either quarantined or removed recently.


.. admonition:: Ryan (Joined Sep 2002, 27,035 posts) on 10-25-2016, 04:37 AM
 
 It was quarantined, yes. Basically incels who advocate for putting women in cages as sex slaves to treat those who can never get to have shared sexual intercourse themselves. Geniunely scary, upsetting stuff that rises out of the sludge of masculine culture.

 Euuuuww. I had blocked "incel" from my mind, but out of curiosity searched up "trucel". Seems like they're celibate because they can't have sex with ten year olds or something. Step up from acting on it, but good grief, this is an actual political thing.

 Christ, when I looked it up on r/OutOfTheLoop I saw someone mention that the deal with Trucels was basically them being bitter that they couldn't bang 10 year olds which.... fuck, I was hoping it was some sort of exaggerated joke but then nope, it really is a bunch of red pill types directly victim blaming children and talking about how they'd abuse them like it ain't nothing but something to do. Someone else described a Trucels as being sort of like priests which I thought meant celibate for religious reasons but again, NOPE, they meant because priests have been known to bugger alter boys. 
 
 I'm not a strong believer in the concept of an afterlife but there's a very special place in Hell for these fuckers (Actually, let's not call them fuckers. Almost implies they're getting laid which, lol clearly not).

 Fuck, I was barely halfway down that Imgur page when I posted the above message and am now at the part where someone compares forcing a child to eat broccoli to forcing a child to have sex because it's not like the kid is consenting to the former either yet the mom isn't arrested for making the kid do it and just.... I feel like I might actually throw up reading this sick and twisted logic.

 I can't understand how anyone can look at a child and even need a reason not to fuck it.
 
 There's a link at the bottom for another 25 of these.

 DYK that unlike an adult's erect penis, broccoli is an excellent source of vitamin K, vitamin C, chromium and folate as well as dietary fiber, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin E, manganese, phosphorus, choline, vitamin B1, vitamin A (in the form of carotenoids), potassium and copper and due to this can actually be beneficial to a developing child's health?
 
 Because the folks over at fuckin' r/Trucel don't seem to be aware of this, I can tell you that much.

 In all seriousness folks, a simple trigger warning doesn't begin to cover the stuff in that link that @Uncle Kester posted. It's immensely upsetting beyond description to the point of physical illness and I say that as someone who has never had the misfortune of being sexually assaulted.

 I'll admit I had a laugh at your quote sourcing but suffice to say that everything I've heard about that subreddit is like exploring the true bottom of the pits in regards to humanity. AskReddit consistently has a "Most disturbing subreddit" thread that pops up every now and then and Trucels is always the top answer. They quarantined themselves as Reddit was constantly getting complaints about them but I sincerely think that they need to consider outright ridding of it altogether. I have no idea why they think it's ok to have anyone who thinks that way/coldly admits to rape.

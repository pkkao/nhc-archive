 True, it is a mix of those things, but I suppose once you get to the "Seems to feel the same about me" part that Smiling mentioned, a large part of the dread half fades away. Sure, it might still pop up here and there, but it's nowhere near as frequent. At least once the whole "I like you"/"I like you too" stuff is laid out on the table you're more free to enjoy each others company without there being a constantly looming fear of saying something that gives away feelings that you might not want to give away. Like, the risk of scaring the other person away is gone and you're just free to be who you are and they can do the same in kind. Which is also part of the fun of passing the admission mark, because when you're both just free to be yourselves around each other, you get to learn all sorts of little bits and pieces about each other that you wouldn't have known otherwise.

 I looked up Tinder to learn more about it, and it seems you need Facebook, which I don't have. And even if I did get one, I would need a lot of friends so it could calculate stuff. So I guess I won't be getting that.
 
 Cuddlr looks promising, though.

Obviously we are all in control of our own behaviour, and fantasising can in itself lead you to a warped view of someone in real life (just as porn can lead to a warped view of sexual characteristics and their associated humans), but I do wish I was able.
 
 Interesting to read this. I always feel really weird and bad whenever I have dreams/fantasies about my crush, for reasons which I have already specified. Also, congratulations @Smiling Politely

 Nonononono...
 I feel like hell. Earlier today, she accidentally sent "Aw thank you  hug"... and it turned out to be to the wrong person.
 Now, I don't know who it might have been. I can guess, but not be sure.
 This doesn't mean I'm not going crazy over this! What should I do? I almost feel like seriously talking with her about this but I dunno if it's such a good idea. Hell, if I don't know what to do though, I'll probably do it anyway... (in school, definitely not over the chat)...
 I don't know what to do.
 This is literally one of the worst things that could've happened.

 Even if you would be in some sort of a serious relationship, she still has the freedom to send messages to other people besides you. If you want this to work at all, then give her space. With this course you'd fail, sorry. Considering it's a completely harmless thing she wrote.

 Not sure exactly what I'm supposed to be going for?
 Also, I've decided not to talk with her about it. It feels wrong and I would feel like, you know, a dick.

 @Snowpit I was reading this thread backwards as usual, and it honestly took me until the top of the page to realise the reason you were upset was in case the message was an indication of liking someone else the way you like her. As a person who was socialised female, no, girls say things like this all the time - usually to other girls, sometimes guys, but not for any sexual reason most of the time. So just to put your mind at rest, this is absolutely nothing to be stressed about. I had assumed you replied something inappropriate/excited/gushy based on how upset you seem, but it turns out you haven't said that.
 
 Ugh. Another guy tried to get his hand down my skirt (yes, down, not up) so I phoned my crush at 4am like "I'm so sorry, but it's not about this, am I over- or under-reacting?" and told him what happened and generally that I don't trust anyone but him and well, I don't even remember, I was drunk, but I'm so glad I can actually talk to him again even if on some level I still think he's a dick. Everyone else is a bigger dick.   This was like a week ago and I only just thought to post it. He moves away in May. I don't think this is going anywhere, and I don't know why I want it to. I just... cannot at all be bothered with anyone else. In the least melodramatic sense possible, it's him or solitude. And tbqh solitude is fine, and would be easier even than a relationship with him.

 oss, if you act on the fact she sent a " hug" to someone in a text, i will punch you in the internet solar plexus
 i send " hug" all the time to absolutely anyone, it's doesn't mean i want to have sex with them.
 
 and i hope things get better for you, @#Halloween. i'd usually post  hug now but i don't want this to come across as some silly joke post. but you get the sentiment.

 As someone who's never been in a relationship, I gotta say OSS, you need to relax. Being paranoid and/or jealous isn't an attractive quality. Just play it cool.

 Well, I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens.
 Man, who would've thought you could look forward to Wednesday more than Friday?

 I don't get crushes very often, but when I do I just get really nervous and often feel dumb and unworthy of that person's attention. I'll even act extra shy and awkward around them because I am always afraid what they think of me and I just feel dumb mostly...I'll never go up to them or ask them out or anything because honestly I have no clue how to do any of that stuff without looking like an idiot. Usually just assume they're taken or want nothing to do with me either since I feel like i'm never worthy of anyone's attention (let alone a male that i'm attracted to). Even so, the though of any guy ever being interested in me just seems foreign and impossible to me to comprehend. I feel like i'll forever be alone because of this never ending cycle of self pity and social awkwardness. I know nobody will ever approach me either and it still baffles me how anybody ever gets together because I feel like it's impossible for me to ever meet anyone let alone make new friends or anything close to something romantic.

 Sometimes, on the occasions that a guy has liked me back, I've actually flirted with him under the pretense that we may start dating....then once I have him, I decide I'm not interested anymore and let him down. Shitty I know, but I don't fell compelled to go beyond that point.

 I've decided that I should take it a little cool. If I ask her too many times if she wants to do something, she'll grow tired of hearing it and not want to. I shouldn't pressure her.
 One thing I've noticed is that I try so desperately to make her laugh that I use VERY dry humor. It's starting to feel more and more painful and I wish I just could think up easier ways of getting the conversation going.
 Otherwise, I'm fine. I'm glad I even get to speak with her without any issue and I'm always happy to be around her. All I need is patience.
 However, should I ask her if we can keep contact when it's the last lesson and fall break arrives, or should I take it even easier and just TRY REALLY FUCKING HARD waiting till school starts again?

 Plain and simple, if she isn't interested in you, there isn't really anything you can do to make her like you.

 What?
 I didn't say she wasn't interested in me. I don't know what she thinks about me yet. I said I was fine with the situation as it is.

 I didn't directly mean you. I was just saying generally.

 Oh.
 But anyway...
 If you have a suggestion as for what I should do when it comes the last question, that would be GREAT...

 To be honest I haven't really had any serious crushes, but if there is a girl I like I just try to be more confident and funnier than usual. Which has not been successful considering that my stats are this: girls I like(d) who like(d) me - 0, girls I don't/didn't like who like(d) me - 2, girls banged - 0.

 I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me.

 Have you ever done anything together then, or is she always busy, later etc?
 
 If yes and you have done something together and she seemed to enjoy your company, then i see no harm in asking to keep in contact.

 We've only seen each other at math and she seems to enjoy my company, but she has always said "We'll talk about it later" or "We'll see". I think it just is that she still doesn't know me that well yet and is unsure.

 Just add her on a social network or something.

 Sweet, I met her today coincidentally while on my short break before another lesson.
 We only talked for a few minutes, but it was still worth it. Apparently she studies latin, by the way 
 I also saw her later walking down the stairs, but she was probably just going to begin a lesson and I didn't want to seem like I had been following her (even though I wouldn't have), so I skipped. But I still got to talk with her!


.. admonition:: OldSchoolerSimpsons (Joined Aug 2013, 15,333 posts) on 10-13-2014, 10:53 AM
 
 I had math, so I once again saw her. Delightful as usual! Even better when I also saw her afterwards going somewhere. I just looked at her and smiled, so she smiled back and said "Hi" with her lips. (She didn't really speak, I just knew what she said)
 Still wondering if I should ask her to keep in touch or not, though. It's a math test next week and that day, I don't think there will be time where we can talk with each other, since there also will be a fall break the following week after that.

 I do in my heart want this to go well for OSS.  But from the little tidbits he's been telling us I just don't see that happening.

 I tend to act skiddish if I'm near someone I like, which is bad, because I get clumsy when I'm like that. More often than not, I end up unintentionally making myself look like an idiot in front of them.

 I try to simultaneously avoid and be in the visual path of the crush in question at all times.
 
 So far, it appears that the first part of that little attention-seeking tango works better than the second.

 Is it time to ask her phone number or propose an actual date, OSS? You don't want to be stuck at 'hey wanna go do something sometimes' for the rest of the year

 I need the girl I like to break up with her damn boyfriend already. She likes talking to me, and when I'm out in the hall waiting for class, she always sits by me. So maaaaaybe there's a chance.

 I don't know. It's just that most of this country has this crazy idea that you can only be in one relationship at a time.


.. admonition:: Johnny Deformed (Joined Nov 2012, 20,889 posts) on 10-14-2014, 06:04 AM
 
 So you're saying that people should openly have affairs with other people and their partners are expected to forgive them and just deal with it every time? Huh
 
 There's a kind of trust you have if you're in a relationship, and finding out that your partner is having an affair would completely break that trust.

 why do I have trouble moving on. Every time I see the girl I wanted to ask out all summer in what appears to be a relationship with one of my fraternity brothers, I feel sick. Not out of their happiness. Out of my own choices. Even when I start liking other girls, I focus on what I missed out on.
 
 help.

 I think it's a common bad habit for some to focus on their regrets or on what they missed out on. "Fear of missing out" is a big issue for a lot of people nowadays. I don't really know the whole story with this girl but some crushes just really stick with us for a little bit before we can move on. Just remind yourself it does you no good to wallow in what could have been. Time moves forward and so should you.

 I guess the other thing that has made it so bad for me, is I am suspecting she might have been wondering how long it'd be until I would try asking her out. I never had a chance to. Flat out. If I hang out with someone one-on-one, run into them at the best time when the day's not busy, I'm better at saying what's on my mind.
 
 I walked by her today. She looked up, said hi, waved a bit, but I could tell there was some awkwardness in it. All because I can't ask people at parties. I even sat at her table during one of the last events last semester. That was my moment to get to know her and her friends. Then my friends pulled me to another table. I waited all summer, got my own hopes up again, and I still wonder what's really left around here.

 Agree. I remember back in school when I was like, 13 maybe, this one kid tried to give me shit for having big ears or something dumb about their shape and like, this was a kid who got shat on for bein' fat a lot, even our fuckin' Geography teacher made a crack at him once about his cheeseburger consumption. It was so clearly just reaching for something to give anyone else shit for that it was just like "Dude, is everything okay?".

 Yeah my isn't really a crush anymore. Because she's my girlfriend. We even put our arms around each others back today. It was cool.

 Yeah I think so. I'd googled what it meant. And yes.

 Uh... so I feel I should clarify that the guy I was referring to in this story was actually a friend of mine. Matter of fact he was a fairly close friend of mine at the time for the 4 years or so that we were in the same class. He was killed in the early hours of this morning. He was hit by a truck. Guys, I know this isn't the right thread for this but... fuuuuuuuuck this just doesn't feel real. Like, this can't have happened. Seeing all the old names from my secondary school days popping up because of the news is just really fucking surreal. He was too young to die and just... none of this feels real and I'm sorta hoping that it's just one huge, tasteless hoax. Sorry for rambling. Just needed to vent for a minute.

 Much appreciated. I was chatting to another old friend (Childhood best friend, actually) about it on FB. Says he'd let me know if he heard anything about when the wake/funeral was gonna be taking place, so yeah, got that coming up.
 
 Sorry to have disrupted the thread with uncomfortable news of such a depressing nature. Ya'll feel free to resume posting about your love lives or lack thereof.

 I'd tried to hold my gf's hand again today. But she didn't really want to hold it. It felt kinda awkward. When trying too.

 Was your hand sweaty and/or sticky?


.. admonition:: Corndog (Joined Jun 2016, 444 posts) on 09-19-2016, 04:57 PM
 
 Not as far as I know it. But I still love her and she loves me. Let's hope this doesn't end up being in a friend zone. I mean I think of her more than just a friend.

 He's in love. Stop trying. Too ruin it.

 He's acting like holding his gf's hand at the wrong moment will fuck up their whole relationship.

 I'm 17 and a senior in high school. My GF is 15 and 10th grade.

 Oh ok. I'm sure its fine though. Have you talked to her about it?

 No not really.

 Not really the thread for this but so it goes...
 
 Just realised that my first long-term girlfriend unfriended me on facebook. It's kinda bummed me out for some reason and I can't really work out why. I don't have feelings for her or anything like that. Just a bit surprised I guess.
 
 When she last spoke to me, a couple of months ago, everything seemed cool. We broke up about a year and a half ago but had stayed pretty good friends until I left uni. It's not like there's ever been drama and we've both dated other people since and stuff.
 
 I figured we'd always be vaguely in contact but I guess not.

 That's a bummer. I think I've only ever had one ex unfriend me on FB. It's one of those things where some past relationships were during my teen years before I even started properly using FB and I'm on fairly good terms with my exs because y'know, nobody's holding grudges over stupid teen shit that feels like a lifetime ago and even ones from more recent years didn't end on a particularly sour note or anything so it's not like I can't still bump into someone and be civil and casually chat about random shit for a bit.

 Yeah I know people who have been through messy break-ups who are still friends on fb. Unfriending just seems a bit passive-aggressive. But I can't think of why she'd act that way.  I think she's just started seeing someone new now so maybe that plays into it in some way. Weird that she's still friends with all my family aha.


.. admonition:: Shaunbadia (Joined Jul 2007, 28,670 posts) on 10-04-2016, 07:09 PM
 
 I mean, she wasn't dating your family so I doubt the new BF would care as much about that if that's really the reasoning behind her unfriending you.

 I just started suddenly feeling really sad today, even holding back tears, and I just couldn't figure out why. But I realized just now it could be because I realized a girl I've talked with on Tinder hasn't answered in 3 days now, which then subconciously made me feel saddened by it. Even though I'm trying not to think about it. I know she sent her phone in for reparation since it's broken (she told me she would the next day last time we wrote to each other), but it still sends a lump in my throat that it's just silent, and I don't know when she will write back. This probably shouldn't be the biggest deal since I can't guarantee it will lead to anything, but with so many past failures this kind of stuff has me broken down by just the littlest bad change. So yeah, not feeling so well right now, could use some cheering up

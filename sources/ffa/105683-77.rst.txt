 This is one great thread. It's iconicness has brought it to be unlocked many times, just a shame I wasn't here for the start of it. Anyway, I haven't gone full creepiness with my girlfriend yet, I'm just slowly building it on, as a nice, friendly relationship.

 just finished a full re-read
  @OldSchoolerSimpsons I know you don't care at all for me but suffice it to say this whole tome is one of the funniest things I've ever read and I've probably read it six times now. I do genuinely hope you find that special someone one of these days. won't prod for deets tho
 
 might as well produce a crush story that nobody has heard before: three years ago I got fired from my job, but right before that a coworker was heavily flirting with me. I didn't want to ask her out, because we're coworkers. then I got canned. I decided to look her up on social media and could not find her. that's it. that's the end.
 
 crush-free for three whole years. what a world

 I'm usually mean to someone I have a crush on.
 
 Flawed idea I know, but unfortunately it's instinctual. 
 
 Sometimes it has worked though.

 I used to hate this thread with a passion, but I recognize its importance now for other people to tell their own personal stories. You can forget about me sharing any more myself though.

 I've had sort of a boycrush on a guy lately. We've slept already but just as a friend thing. Though last time we hung out we made out and all that, but when I was leaving I kissed him goodbye. Even though we've made out and slept, I really regret that. Feels really weird. That's more of a dating thing, as opposed to a friend hookup thing. Was really awkward. I apologized later and he said it was fine cause he liked it, but I don't think it's fine...

 This Board sometimes I think I might just be too stupid for the internet.

 Having crushes makes me not want to have a sex drive. Useless piece of shit that thing is.

 so there's this girl from work I've been crushing on for a little while now. and it's different than usual, because I'm actually... friends with this person? like we actually talk to each other sometimes,  we've hung out a couple times, stuff like that... so right now I'm in a better state with her than anyone I've had a crush on. well, a few weeks ago she tells me, out of the blue, that she's leaving work, "Until restrictions are over," and then I hear that she's probably not coming back...
 
 so, in light of all that,  I have a new response:
 
 "get drunk and make an ass out of yourself via messages"
 
 I had decided to get drunk and message her some shit off messenger; it was mostly like "thanks for being a good friend, I'm gonna miss you," and stuff like that. somewhere along the way I thought it would be a swell idea to LINK "All Out of Love" TO HER{I must have planned on sending that elsewhere... but I digress}. 
 
 I'm a loser when it comes to love and relationships because I have never felt love, and I've only been in one relationship my life; but with this girl, I genuinely never have felt like this before. she's about all I can think about... I should note that I apologized to her for my messages- sober- and she flat out said "oh it's OK, don't even worry about it." like what kind of girl is going to get messages/linked love songs sent to them and NOT delete that person/hold something against them?
 
 we still do talk every now and then and I am holding out hope that she does eventually return to the restaurant, but... golly. these feelings... all new to me. only took 26{!} years for me to feel... I don't know how I feel. like I said... a way I've never felt before. and I wanna hold on to it... whatever that even means.

 There's been at least three threads where Mr Black has answered a question with some variation of "No because I'm not a WOMAN" like a) that thing is femme and b) being femme is a terrible thing. So even if he has never posted anything else overtly homophobic, I have no problem believing it, as much of homophobia is rooted in the perception that gay and bi men are feminine and therefor weak and inferior.

 because that was obviously a dig back at you after you took a(however warranted) dig at the u.s.
 
 i knew i had called you a dumb brit recently, but i didn't realize my usage wasn't as toxic as you made it sound.

 Son: Dad, I have some news, you better sit down.
 Dad: Of course, what is it son?
 Son: I'm- I'm gay
 Dad: What- really?
 Son: Oh I knew you'd be like this, you're just a closet homophones you are *bursts into tears and runs upstairs*

 Well for one, Panther wasn't engaging you in a discussion on his sexual orientation. Second, you said you thought it was a typo, so it sounds like you meant to poke fun at that. Maybe just don't be a jackass?

 i think i'm in a love triangle. i like guy, guy likes me, guy seems to like girl more, girl likes guy.
 
 last night i was way more flirty than normal. there's got to be no doubt in his mind that i'm interested in him otherwise he's oblivious as fuck.

 I'd say that's an image that supports board members being reasonable upset. I mean, the scene is from The Cartridge Family, Homer used all their dinner plates for target practice.

 Not defending anyone in particular but the quoting really doesn't bother me. Quite often a thread moves on fast, so you'd allow for that when preparing your response. It's also faster than tagging with a lot of usernames.

 But this thread wasn't moving fast??? Plus chris could've just posted the image it would've worked fine without even quoting me.

 Also, if the thread is movin fast and you feel the need to quote something(even tho a million people have already quoted it) your post more than likely will not appear right under what you're quoting


.. admonition:: kes (Joined Nov 2011, 5,527 posts) on 02-09-2016, 11:18 AM
 
 Thread can begin moving fast at any time; it's not predictable. I'd feel compelled to go back and apologise for crossposting if my scathing response hit the wrong poster.

 I can also tell when a thread is moving down into the dumpster.
 
 Which it now is.

 No, but to be honest, I feel happy about this. Why do you have to be so negative?

 Next wednesday, ask her if we can all add her on facebook. We'll be your wingmen!

 There is a test next wednesday, so I will have no time talking with her then

 But you have her on facebook now. Ask her on her timeline, or invite her to the NoHomers Club facebook page

 I can think of several reasons I don't want her to join this forum.

 And this thread too.

 No this thread is flattering to her
 But maybe we should print it and present it to OSS & OSSgirl on their wedding which we all will be invited too

 I think she will end up cheating on him with his glasses and he will be very angry at his glasses

 The great thing is, from now on every wednesday when OSS sees her, he will think of her fucking his glasses

 Matty, you need medical help.


.. admonition:: Matty (Joined Oct 2001, 3,854 posts) on 10-15-2014, 12:47 PM
 
 I will open the thread asking for medical help once we've helped you with your dating problems. One at a time, please

 Once she accepts your facebook friend request, you should do a cover of this song for her

 As a person who never had a Facebook, I'm not sure what's so bad about this. Does it make it too obvious that he likes her?


.. admonition:: Ryan (Joined Sep 2002, 27,035 posts) on 10-15-2014, 08:53 PM
 
 very, considering facebook requests are usually considered the mildest form of "acquaintance" possible in this age outside of maybe "work friends"

 It's just kind of redundant to ask someone if you can add them on facebook since when you send a request it asks them to agree or decline the request.

 Yes, I've talked with her a little through there. She's up in a whole lot now though since she has 3 big tests next week, holy shit.
 But she seems to be fine and is acting very nice

 Tests always seemed a good excuse to send a few texts. Use it wiseley

 Hey, I have a question: The girl I like hasn't been to class for two classes in a row. I'm wondering if I should send her a friendly email. Something like, "Hi Martha! How are you doing? I hope you're feeling all right. You're my only friend here, and I miss you! Hope to see you soon!"
 
 Do you think she'd consider that nice, or just weird?


.. admonition:: The Goode Family (Joined Jan 2013, 11,702 posts) on 10-17-2014, 10:59 AM
 
 well if you're her friend i don't think she'd find it weird


.. admonition:: Matty (Joined Oct 2001, 3,854 posts) on 10-17-2014, 11:02 AM
 
 Sure, especially if you are that friendly with each other. Most girls would appreciate that. How many days has it been?
 
 I would edit that 'only friend' part, though. Sounds a bit too lonely. Maybe just bring it down to 'Miss you & hope to see you soon!' if you want it to become more than just friends


.. admonition:: Financial Panther (Joined Aug 2007, 26,500 posts) on 10-17-2014, 11:05 AM
 
 It's only been two days. Maybe I should wait to see if she's gone on Monday too. And thanks for the advice. I'll change it if I end up sending it.


.. admonition:: Matty (Joined Oct 2001, 3,854 posts) on 10-17-2014, 11:12 AM
 
 Two days may be a bit short, but on the other hand you can end your message by wishing her a nice weekend. I'd say you could go for it

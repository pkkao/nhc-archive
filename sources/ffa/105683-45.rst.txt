 I mean, yeah, I don't know what you expected. This is just some girl. You barely know her, you cannot possibly be in love with her, I mean this is the crush thread...yet you act exactly like all the terrible overdone clichés go. You're sitting on a couch for 2 hours waiting for a glimpse when you could be doing anything else including finding another person to date or talk to. But "not seeing her again" is somehow worse than going and doing anything other than sitting on that couch. It would be kinda funny if it got back to her first that "some guy just sits for hours and does nothing, I dunno!!" and then she decides to completely not bother going near creep-couch ever again.
 
 Based on that "I don't want to be alone" thing you just really make it sound even more like you're trying to force anything to happen with any girl you end up finding cute enough to crush on. Don't be desperate. It's not even necessary. And it certainly isn't going to help. It's just gonna...make you act like this.

 Yes. Get a haircut. And give things time. Thinking it has to happen now or it will never happen will only get in your way.

 yeah it's not productive behavior. you whine and moan about being alone but you hardly seem to be doing anything about it--waiting hours for some random chick isn't helping and it's quite detrimental. plus you're fuckin what 18? quit acting like you're on your deathbed and you're gonna die alone  even tho you might with this kinda behavior

 Plus being desperate usually leads to (if you find a partner) being clingy and endlessly needy which isn't a good thing in a relationship

 most people would find it very uncomfortable and awkward for some random guy who he/she barley even know to just show up at the same place everyday and start chatting. this puts that poor girl in a very awkward spot where she probably has to pretend to be interested in what the heck you're saying as to spare your feelings. it's just not normal behavior dude, not trying to be a dick just telling it how it is. just act normal and don't try to force a relationship with someone you barley know just cause you think they're cute.

 If you're really that lonely you should give dating sites a crack OSS. I mean, it seems like you know next to nothing about this girl. At least with online dating you'll get an idea of how compatable you are and you'll know for certain that the other person is looking for something

 Why not install okcupid or tinder on your phone if you have two free hours on the sofa every day anyway

 I get that being alone can feel lonely, but if you aren't okay with being alone then maybe you aren't ready to be apart of a relationship. Being able to just exist with yourself in peace is a pretty important part of being with another person. Being in a relationship can be great, but not if you're only in it because you don't want to be alone. You should be with a person because you want to be with them, not because you don't want to be alone.
 
 Besides, you're literally a teenager. You are not withering away, doomed to be an old maid. You have years to find someone, and it'll probably happen when/where you least expect. And if you really want to try out dating now, a dating site is pretty ideal given that they are entirely made to find other people. 
 
 And if you ever only follow one piece of advice ever posted in this thread, please let it be "don't be a stalker." Because that shit is terrifying.

 OSS if yr lonely:
 
 1) maybe think about this outside relationship terms? do you have friends you can talk to about this, bond with? basically what i'm getting at is - why, in a deeper sense, are you lonely? let's face it, it's not just because you're single. there's more going on here and you need to be honest with yourself about what it is. maybe you need to meet some new friends or something? work on your self esteem? i don't know, i know nothing about you. but figure all that out and not only will you be more comfortable in your own skin, alone, but you'll be in a far healthier place to maintain a relationship when you eventually get one. 
 
 2) loneliness sucks but it does not give you the right to violate other peoples personal space???? you may be desperate and lonely (the desperateness you really need to address, see point 1) but other people very likely might not be and they are entitled to their security and privacy. world doesn't just revolve around u, bud

 I think the key thing here is whether or not you care how the object of your affection feels. Like, if you want them to be happy you can make that your guide. If you're only bothered about what they want insofar as it serves you, how is it going to be a relationship?

 I'm hoping that when we meet a nice place and can just talk about each other among other stuff (like some café or you know, anything but a flippin' couch at school) I from there on can do anything to make her happy.

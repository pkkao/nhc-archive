 We get along really well. Pretty sure she does want to. You don't know her, so stop acting like you know what she wants or doesn't want.

 It does make sense. But maybe she's just a little miss perfect who follows the rules.
 
 Still that's too bad Panthy

 i mean it's a pretty common rule that exists in a lot of work places, it's claimed to be a conflict of interests and even a distraction.  plus what if you go with the girl for a while then things turn sour, now you have to work with someone who you no longer get along with too well.

 yeah it's the same at school dude
 our school doesn't encourage dating as people go through break ups and you know how teens are, and whenever things inevitably go to shit they still have to go to school the next day and see that person
 im worried that's gonna happen with me and ella but ill try and make it so if we do break up its not horrible angsty teenager shit

 lol no public school could enforce a no dating policy ever

 mm yeah everyone would simply date and not tell anyone in that case at my schools.
 
 Totally remember our soccer coaches at one point telling the boys and girls teams "we don't mind if you hang out at each others practices for team support but no distractions AND NO FLIRTING"

 they expect you to study and do schoolwork and shit, so you can be a productive member of society someday


.. admonition:: kupomog (Joined Feb 2002, 37,972 posts) on 03-25-2016, 01:21 PM
 
 Uh yeah they expect you to pay attention to school and your work so you don't do stupid shit like sit and pine over getting some tail all semester long as if it's the most important thing in the world
 
 Super easy to circumvent getting caught mid-PDA though so I mean, these rules are really nothing.

 All right, that is an okay enough post to end this debate with.

 Man I know that's not what you asked but all I pictured was Tommy Wiseau goin' "Anyway, how's your sex life?"   
 
 We're good, tho. We were supposed to meet up and hang out in my office for lunch this afternoon because of the holiday and no traffic. It's pouring rain out though, so our plans were cancelled.

 Today I went on a second date with the girl I've known for long.
 
 First, we met up at the same place as last time. I had told her beforehand I cut myself while shaving, which is why I wouldn't look that good. She said it was barely noticeable. Even if was a white lie it made me glad to hear that, haha. Anyway, instead of staying there this time we headed to Slottsskogen, a very nice place where could just relax and have a picnic. We sat down at a park bench since I forgot to bring a blanket. But I worked just fine. We sat there talking about various stuff, then started eating after a half hour or more had passed. I had packed the bag with waffles (along with jam and whipped cream in separate plastic boxes), hot water in a thermos plus two tea bags. One for us each. They were lemon flavored. And lastly, two blood oranges. Eating the food went fine. ... For a while. Inside the thermos, there was an extra layer with sugar cubes. For the second cup, she wanted some sugar in her tea. But she couldn't get it to open, so I tried to help her. I couldn't do it either, I got so frustrated I smashed the thermos against a tree. She chuckled and said it was fine, but I tried for a little longer before giving up. Shortly after that, our paper plates and waffles flew away... SEPARATELY. I had to chase one of the plates at least three times, and then dropped the cutlery so much dirt got on them. But none of us were angry. Instead, we were laughing our asses off just because of the ridiculous trouble. After a while, we got up from the bench and went for a walk. First we went towards the old neighborhood she lived at, but she changed her mind and we walked the opposite direction instead. I didn't mind, I told her (I don't know how many times) "We'll do what you feel like". I wanted to give her as much leeway as possible not because I didn't have many ideas, but also because I felt she deserved it for being such a nice and wonderful person. I acted quite whimsical while we walked, I grabbed a lamp post twice and started singing "I'm singiiiiiin' in the rain....". The second time, she jokingly corrected me that I was "Singin' in the shades" because it was, you know, very shadowy. Oh God, I laughed so hard when she said that. I also sung a made-up parody version of "Staying Alive" (can't remember the title), which she thought was very funny. When we had walked for a good hour or so, she wanted to eat a small meal at Burger King, which I agreed to. She ordered fries with bearnaise sauce and a soda to drink (Fanta), while I ordered an Oreo dessert and cappuccino. We talked a bit about movies and shows, and she even managed to invest me when she talked about video games, which I rarely ever play. I also entertained her by coming up with voices for her food (and my coffee, which I made insult me for drinking it up so slowly). Even though she already had food, I also offered her some of mine. She tried my Oreo dessert and she gave me some fries in exchange. After a while we left, but I took the tram with her to her stop. While on the ride, we were a little more quiet, but I made her laugh when she spilled some juice from the blood orange on her clothes and I tried to wipe it off with my napkin. After we got off, she waited for the tram I would take home to arrive. We hugged each other and then said goodbye.
 
 This is the most amazing Easter I've ever had in my life.

 I forgot just two short details in my write-up. She said at one point that I was the only one she could talk with about movies extensionally since nobody else at school liked talking about movies at a more detailed level. I felt flattered, to say the least!
 She also mentioned that if it wasn't for me writing to her, recess would be much more boring. Such a sweet thing to say

 Good for you, bud. I'm happy for you. I think I'm fairly close to having a girlfriend myself, despite what drivel handy may spout.

 I don´t have a girlfriend yet and i don´t think i´m close to having one either at the moment but i have gotten a lot better at dealing at girls over the years. When i was like eight i would stalk the girl i had a crush on and ask her out every chance i could get but now i always take it in a calm way, try to talk normally to the girl i might be interested in and if i realize she just likes me as a friend i let her do that and don´t force her to be together with me.

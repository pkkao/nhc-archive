 I just saw that someone had posted in this thread and figured it was something of my interest.

 He's fast in replying because you're his new person of interest, @boodlesoup

 so, on my facebook's "on this day" app, I found out a bit ago that today is the 6-year anniversary of the year I won homecoming.
 
 the thing is, everybody knew I liked this girl, and so pretty much everyone voted for me and the girl as a joke. we won.
 
 that was one of the most awkward dances, if not the most awkward dance, of my life. sigh. 
 
 I don't even like her anymore but I just thought I'd share that.

 it saves a lot of stress, and time. no-one should waste their time with someone that isn't right for them

 Okay, I'm experiencing some serious inner conflicts.
 
 The girl that I used to be infatuated with only has mentioned occasionally about how she'd like to my house some time. Which would be incredibly nice and all, but...
 I've also started getting interested in another girl (who I first met at a workshop, we recently took up contact again) who is... just as lovely.
 
 The problem is that I still care about both of them. I've admittedly been paying more attention to the other girl lately, but I still have feelings underneath for the first and I know, I know... that I would get the same tingling feeling if I saw her again.
 So what the fuck? What are my actual feelings?! Could it be that I'm interested in both, but in very different ways?
 The girl I've talked about the most, we don't have a lot in common, but we still manage to have a wonderful time when we talk. On the other hand, I have a lot more in common with the other girl, and we both share the same weird sense of humor. I'm not as nervous and she's much easier to talk to! This probably makes you think "Oh, you should definitely go for her". But it's not that easy! I feel ashamed of getting interested in someone else, I feel embarrassed. Like I've given up. And I want to keep talking to both of them without problem! When I check to see what the other girl has written way more often than what the first girl has, I go "What the fuck is wrong with you, man???".
 
   @kes, you know about conflicting feelings. Maybe you can help me out??

 so you fancy/like two girls? you're like 18? you could fancy/like 100 girls and it would be normal.
 it's not like you are actively in love with both of them, you just have crushes. just talk and enjoy the company of both of them. become friends. see what feels natural, and go with it.
 at the minute you aren't really in a position to have to make any kind of choice. it's not like they have both declared they are in love with you and you have to choose. at the minute, just focus on getting to know both of them better, and let time dictate who you truly prefer in romantic terms.
 
 just don't commit bigamy 10 years from now oss.

 This is v important.
 
 Talk to both. 
 
 Love isn't decided the moment you set eyes on a single person. Many factors go into whether a relationship starts/works/fails. It's something you have to make happen with another. Having several crushes at a time isn't abnormal.
 
 There is no reason why you cannot just interact with both girls as friends at the same time, especially since you are dating neither. You have to actually spend time with both to understand your feelings, anyway. Let the girl see your house, keep talking to the other girl. Just letting someone see your house doesn't mean they are in love with you and want to date, after all. 
 
 And also as an example just because you fall in love with the right person and make the decision to spend your life with them doesn't mean crushes can't still happen. My husband is well aware of my own crushes when they happen (not often) but this isn't necessarily wrong nor unhealthy. There is a prevailing theory that humans are not naturally monogamous.

 I'm in the same boat, except I'm not attracted to Person #2, or #3, and so on. If you are interested in this second girl, do not feel shame for it. Keep your options open, man. It does sound like she's more interested in you than Girl #1 is, but only you can really gauge that. If neither of them has asked you to commit, you have no need to commit to one of them over the other. See where it goes!

 Well, I'm meeting a beautiful girl this Friday to have fun ripping apart a bad movie (which was her own idea) 
 
 Here's how she looks like (I learned my lesson from last time, so I blurred her face out):

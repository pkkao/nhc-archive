 i don't want to have crushes. i'd rather not devote all my time and attention to one single person who doesn't feel the same about me. i'm not even sure how i would handle a relationship with a boyfriend or girlfriend because it's not like there's a clear distinction for me between friends and just people who i am attracted to - i love my friends and i don't feel like there's any boundaries. if i want to make physical contact with friends then i'll do it without hesitation. if i love my friends and feel as if there's no boundaries, then yeah, that's a good way to live i think.

 It feels so great though when you know they're thinking the same sappy romantic thoughts about you and that you're both just so into each other. Like a permanent buzz.

 Tbh it feels great when they acknowledge me, message me first, agree with something I post on Fb... just reassuring to know I made the shortlist of people worth talking to in this person's case.

 Yup, I remember how happy it made me when he liked one of my fb posts

 if you like it when your crush hugs you or whatever, make sure you do it often to them as well. don't just wait ages for your crush to do it to you.

 teenage angst post
 
 I am torn between two girls. One I have deep deep conversations with about everything and anything and she likes everything I like and says I'm a great person and all that jazz. The other always comes to me for help with things and makes me feel like a great person when I help her and we have a lot of fun when we chat
 
 I do not believe for a minute that either are attracted to me. I know I should have a crush on the former. I do not know what to do. i feel like person 1 genuinely likes me as a person however, which kind of helps

 assuming that they're nothing more than crushes, why not have both at the same time?
 
 or alternatively, "if you love two people at the same time, choose the second. because if you really loved the first one, you wouldn't have fallen for the second."

 my second person is the first one I talked about. seems like she is on the front of my mind at the moment 
 
 fuck I don't even want to tell her cause I'm so happy with what we talk about and shit and I don't want that ruined

 My suggestion (don't completely trust my judgment though, I've been in/am in love trouble myself) is that you hold off on telling her until you notice how she's partaking a similar interest in you. Although you can still maybe ask her if she want to go out or something like that.
 
 I dunno, ask  @kupomog for help. She's the ultimate NHC expert at relationship advice.

 ive asked her if she wants to go see columbus live in October and she says that depends what her dad says

 Not at all an expert, just have experience to relay. Thanks for the compliment tho.
 
 You basically already asked her out so just gotta see what the result is.

 Recently I've noticed if I gain a crush on a girl I've just met, I actually can talk to them for hours on end without the conversation dying. That's not who I was a year ago and I think I'm on the right path to finally finding somebody on campus.

 After what felt like an eternity, I finally met up with her for another date.
 I decided to myself that anything resembling uncomfortable questions would make the whole experience unsettling. So I avoided them.
 I was hungry, so we both went to a vegetarian resturant (nothing all that luxurous, but still) where we just talked about general stuff, how school was going and such. Sometimes I joked around a bit.
 There were a few short silences inbetween where I was just nervously eating while looking at her and thinking about how beautiful she was. Like an angel struck down from heaven.
 After we had eaten (she only had some cake and a cup of citrus tee, she had already eaten lunch), we took a little walk before her bus arrived.
 
 It was wonderful.

 this quote from doctor who would pretty much sum up what i think when i see a girl:
 
 "you're a beautiful woman, probably"

 Y'know, I dunno how much more I can take it. I just asked her (as politely as possible) if we could see each other sometime and she angrily replied that she is under a lot of stress and wonders when I will understand that. Christ, I... This is just unbelievable. I can't believe this is happening. And it followed just after an very tender conversation too.
 As quickly as everything seems all right again, I'm suddenly broken down even more.
 
 Fuck it, I don't know what to do. I've even considered if I should start going for someone else instead.
 
 I mean, for every time this kind of thing happens, I begin to love her a little less. What if I'm wrong, that she's not the right one after all?

 so, from page 1 to now, this is still the same woman correct?
 
 if so, for all of us, move on
 
 as for me, I kept hearing for about a month that the new training class are a bunch of twentysomethings (younger than usual for a casino/hotel call center) and they just started. I've been a bit nervous of possibly catching the infatuation bug on one of them, and luck struck again as they're all really annoying and loud young'uns (21/20) obsessed with partying and each other and I hate them all. except for this relatively quiet, but cute-ish asian girl who leaves shortly after the beginning of my shift and I haven't talked to her and she smiles/blushes at me everytime I look her way and my immediate thought is, "please stop. do you want me to gain a hopeless crush? because this is how I gain a hopeless crush." hopefully she gets another shift (they're all steady extras) and I can stay crush-free. it's defeating and depressing, but cheerfully emotionally stable!

 No, it was someone else in the beginning, but she was only briefly. Mostly, it has been the same one.

 @John Milton, you gotta tell her what you tell us. Literally just tell her to get her act together or you're going to move on. It sounds harsh, but by the sounds of it, she could do with some harsh words.


.. admonition:: kupomog (Joined Feb 2002, 37,972 posts) on 10-09-2015, 09:33 AM
 
 Uh no it doesn't sound like she could do with some "harsh words," wtf. 
 
 Respect what she is saying to you. If she doesn't want to go out, she doesn't want to.

 Actually this sounds exactly like what that girl needs to be honest:
 
 "I'm sick of this, you need to get your act together, go out with me again or i'll move on"
 
 "Yeah alright. Off you fuck then"

 OSS, it honestly sounds like you're making her feel you're being pushy. It also sounds she's at a place in her life where she too pre-occupied with other things to go dating. Are you fine with being her friend without keeping hoping for more every day and constantly asking her for dates? Because otherwise she might always think you have an hidden agenda and feel uncomfortable, which will get you nowhere.

 It's not easy. I mean, I try to be satisfied with how the situation is, but some days I miss her so much it hurts

 It sounds like you just need to go for a Hail Mary romantic move. Lay it all out on the table. This is clearly the person you're destined to marry so why play all the games?

 Just give her a rest. If there are "tender conversations" it sounds like she at least cares how you feel, but you're grinding her patience. If you're able to move on to someone else, then good for you. I can't. I'm demisexual and it's really a wonder I fell for the person I fell for at all. I'm happy with the way things are because it gives me hope that I could one day have a mutually loving relationship if I want one. I, too, managed to piss my object of affection off recently by being hyperavailable. It sounds like for whatever reason she doesn't want to date you at this time. Maybe it's not worth trying to figure out what that reason is. Maybe you should turn your attention to something/someone else if it's at all possible. You might find that you have a genuine friend in her if you give her some space. I got distracted by my new course and thus basically forgot to pester my crush although I think of them often. I'm sure things are better for it.  I know how you feel, but you shouldn't place so much importance on a specific scenario where you get to be with someone who's never given you a strong affirmative.

 Haven't really talked to Goodwill Girl in all this time, but I am considering applying for a job there. My gut instinct tells me this is a terrible idea. In order of likeliness:
 ~She is hetro, end of story.
 ~She is taken with no thoughts towards polyamory.
 ~She is heteroish, but this is not good for my relationship.
 ~She is bi, but this is not good for my relationship.
 ~My SO confirms, as he has suspected, he is equally jealous of girls.
 ~My SO agrees to a three-way, but we regret it.
 ~My SO agrees to a polyamorous relationship, but we regret it. Our relationship is destroyed by it.
 I'm terrified of abandonment. Don't need TWO people abandoning me, esp for each other.
 
 For now I just daydream. I love my SO, I really do. Maybe I'm just feeling so neglected because we're both dealing with mental illness, and I'm dealing with addiction. If I'm honest with myself, a new person wouldn't fix things, they would just be a bandage.

 snowpit if a 14 year old can learn whether or not a girl will fall for him or not surely you can
 
 it's hard to accept but whatever there's more in the world then that one chick, fall for another, woo them with your cans

 I've "already" taken a little interest in someone else, since I've pretty much given up hope at this point.

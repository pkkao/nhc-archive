 Well if people had more than one relationship, it would increase my odds of having one!

 Eh, you're just brainwashed by the customs of some of the world.
 
 Think outside the box, maaaaan!

 Ok, but how do you think you would feel if your partner was being unfaithful to you?

 Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all!

 Maybe she just sees you as a very close friend.
 It's probably not very healthy for you to go and hope for her to break up with him or to be together with you at the same time. Just... Just focus on something/someone else!

 Anyway, I have to make another decision tomorrow. Should I ask for her number/Facebook add or not? Or do I have to endure the damn patience?

 Surely you can add her on Facebook any time. You don't need to ask her permission.

 Of course I could add her, but then she'd wonder how I found her, that shit, which would make the situation uncomfortable.

 Just tell her you wanted to add her on Facebook because she's your friend.

 Okay, I send her a request.
 We'll see what happens. This could make me more nervous than ever, though.

 Fuck it, I cancelled the request.
 I'll just talk to her about it tomorrow. Couldn't hurt, I suppose.

 I've already told you from past experience it's not that easy.

 Don't know why you don't just add her on a social network. This does not have to be so complicated when nothing has even happened yet. You know her name. She is a classmate. That is literally all you need to befriend anyone on FB.  And you don't even NEED the classmate stipulation.

 Okay, I re-sent the friend request, but I'm not still weary about this.

 Hahaha, very fucking funny.

 It went fine. I asked her (just to be safe) if I could add her on Facebook and she said "Yes, but I'm not logged in so often".
 Oh, and it was wonderful seeing her as usual.

 Thanks for the "support" and "uplifting attitude".

 Gosh, this is the kind of person you'd marry for their social skills in the world of the aristocracy.

 I tried registering for the two dating sites that were widely known as the most secure ones.
 But they both costed money, so both attempts failed.
 So even my least favorite method of trying to find someone failed. Fuck.
 Why does it have to be so pricey?
 
  @Financial Panther you lucky bastard, how's it going?

 Me? Oh, she never responded after I told her I would get back to her about a day that would work. I got back to her last week, but no response. So fuck her.

 How long ago was that?
 Anyway, maybe she's just busy. If she still hasn't answered after about three more weeks though...
 
 Sorry to hear this, Panth.

 She hasn't sent me a message in over a month. Whatever, though.
 
 I don't care. I just thought she was interested in doing something since she was the one who came up with it.

 I forgot I was the one who said I would get back to her. I thought she would get back to me. I didn't realize this until I checked it last week wondering why she hadn't responded in almost a month.

 I admit I've thought about holding their hand.
 
 They admit they'd probably puddle into blubbering trash if I did because it's been so long and all the past abuse and vulnerability stuff.
 
  
 
 That's it. I'm dead.

 Okay, she wrote back after all. She said she was feeling bad for what she did and missed getting notifications from me.
 Does this really make me happy? Unfortunately not.
 Not only do I feel uncomfortable writing to her again after finally trying to get over her, but she also suggested we meet up, do something together.
 And this is getting me all fucking panicked. What the hell will I do? Sure I felt nervous when I had a date with her at the cinema, but at least I didn't have a feeling of imminent doom. Now, however, it feels like life screws me over. Now, WHEN IT'S TOO LATE, she suddenly want to see me again. Where the fuck is the justice in that?

 Maybe she just wants to be friends, not the worst thing in the world.

 Ugh just go out with her, Snowpit. It's not "too late" for a fucking thing. If you like her, GO. She's ASKING YOU.

 I send her a Valentine's card that says, "I choo-choo-chooooose you" & there's a picture of a train.
 
 Actually, I don't do anything & sometimes act like I actively dislike them. In this part of the U.S. women respond to strong men with an aire of independence. They also want what they think they can't have. It's terrible & illogical, but it works. It's why the rate of adultery is so high in the area.
 
 On that note, I'd rather be single than a dick & so I've been on my own for two years. It's not bad at all & I feel better about myself than I ever did when I dated around. I refuse to sleep with anyone else's gf/wife so no go.
 
 I got on Plenty Of Fish though so maybe one day a nice girl will inbox me. If not, I'll still be fine on my own ðŸ˜Ž

 Okay, sorry. Now I understand the situation.
 But the best thing right now is honesty. Ask her why she got so angry and tell her that it made you sad. That is better than not replying at all at least.

 Makes perfect sense to me, so I don't really know how to respond to those questions.

 Turns out its easy, flirt a lot but don't say anything because you're a coward, then they tell you they like you instead, you get all cutesy about wanting to ask them out first, and then organise to meet up once you have money.
 
 We probably can't do anything until June probably but still

 I seriously hope nobody will ever ask me out on a date. Perhaps only if i knew the person long enough, i would go. If there's ever somenoe in my sights,  i would just try to have conversations, to hang out, like you do with friends and get to know the person that way. Rather than going to some place on a specific day and having akward time with someone i barely know.

 When my crush likes or favorites something I posted on facebook,instagram,tumblr, or twitter, I analyse said post and try to figure out why they liked it.

 I mostly use facebook for stalking my crush, anyway.
 I mean, erm, I have a huge social life both on and offline

 Just don't like something your crush posted several years ago. Then you're in trouble.

 Oh yeah, I never like anything that my crush posts, which is probably a bit extreme but meh, better safe than sorry.
 Also, is there an interesting story attached to that advice?


.. admonition:: Johnny Deformed (Joined Nov 2012, 20,889 posts) on 05-02-2015, 11:30 AM
 
 No sadly there isn't.


.. admonition:: closeface (Joined Jun 2014, 2,367 posts) on 05-02-2015, 11:31 AM
 
 I recommend that you do it so that we can have a story


.. admonition:: Johnny Deformed (Joined Nov 2012, 20,889 posts) on 05-02-2015, 11:33 AM
 
 Haha sadly I don't have a crush at the moment but when I get one I'll be sure to do that for a laugh.

 Only if you keep it a secret. You know how easily they leak out on this forum...

 My crush turned up to my birthday party today and we exchanged pleasantries and talked about the flooding and a bunch of other things.
 
 Good times all around man

 Is that some sort of expression I'm unfamiliar with? Because I don't know what you mean by that.

 When it comes to crushes and facebook, you always have to be honest. I facebook stalk my crush severely, but I always make sure to tell him about it.


.. admonition:: bias (Joined Dec 2014, 6,550 posts) on 05-03-2015, 06:44 AM
 
 I don't really stalk her as such.
 
 I did back when I used facebook a couple years ago just to see what she got up to in 2011 but now I could care less.

 ...the world is a weird place now

 Far out, and you call me stupid
 
 She wouldve been 11 in 2011, and I would've been 12 at the time of looking at her facebook (she's 15 this year, I wouldve been 12 in early June 2013)
 
 its not like some creepy thing, I was an innocent kid back then with no malicious intention at all. Sure, itd definitely be weird if I did it now as i would clearly know what I would be doing, but at 12 I probably was just looking through her time line.

 well seeing as you're 13, and 2011 was four years ago, that was a pretty easy connection to come to. but ohhhh I'm sorry I forgot to look up the biasesumo wikia and do my research.
 
 still weird that 11 year old girls and younger have facebook.


.. admonition:: bias (Joined Dec 2014, 6,550 posts) on 05-03-2015, 07:10 AM
 
 While yes it is safe to assume I've turned thirteen this year and that I was born in 2002, come Wednesday ill be 14 and you'll know I was born in 2001.
 
 I'd rather 11 year olds had facebook then Ask.FM or Instagram as they are more personal then facebook.
 
 and I could reference Van Halen but I won't sink that low

 My 7 year old cousin has a facebook, but I think she's the only 7 year old i know that has one.. so it doesn't really mean anything

 didn't you quit the board? or have you forgiven us? when may we expect your apology?

 ANYWAY with the info you've presented, i think it seems like you should definitely push forward, especially if you're getting closer physically. go for it

 we should make a rule so that when people quit they aren't allowed to return without being forced to crawl through the supplicants doorand grovel for our forgiveness

 I'm glad my reign of terror has a lasting legacy on this board. Now back to enjoying my retirement

 i'm genuinely only back because i needed a place to vent the drama in my life right now. 
 
 also while it's easy enough to say that i should move forward with this, it's not as easy as it looks. i don't wanna screw up our friendship but at the same time a more intimate relationship would be great. he wants to see me again tonight so it's possible something important will happen. can't say I'm ready for it but I'm sure I'll find some way to deal with it.
 
 fucking nervous though. i've never had a friendship change into this before.

 yeah it can be hard to gravitate towards that, the ruining of a friendship is always a chance, but if you guys seem to be getting more physical and stuff it definitely seems like he's into it, and so are you, so why not give it a try

 just asked him if he wants to meet up for the sixth time this week.
 
 fuuuuuuuuuck
 
 i'm worried that we're becoming obsessed with each other
 
 at least this time i can prepare myself cause i got a feeling something interesting might happen

 ^ At least the feeling is mutual!  Try not to stress.
 
 I dreamt about them last night. Cooincidentally had a query today about their old job so an excuse to get in contact, albeit briefly. Agh. I don't think they like me enough to meet up now we're a few counties apart, but then I'm probably overthinking that. Expense, etc. Plus we're not very physical people. Pity because I'd like someone to snuggle lately. It'd just be pleasant.

 Well, I'm in love with this girl...
 *cue Zapp Brannigan laughing
 
 I've been crazy infatuated with a friend's ex since they were dating, we went to school in the same class and we seem like on good terms with each other. I'm crazy shy or even anti-social :/ Anyway we started talking a little recently, nice good chat and not entirely awkward. I sent her a message a week ago or so that was just a little suggestive, and she hasn't seen it yet, how does someone manage to not see a message on facebook if you're not actively trying to avoid it? ... *sob
 
 So I sit here listening to FF9 and One Piece tracks, it feels like I'm only now entering puberty.

 define "a little suggestive"


.. admonition:: Tromboon (Joined Dec 2013, 1,783 posts) on 01-24-2016, 01:23 PM
 
 along the lines of "hey I think we didn't really talk at school, do you wanna play dota with me and *insert name* "
 
 but I mean, in Swedish it was more refined and civil
 
 But I could add, I suspect she's been through having a friend who ends up having feelings for her more than once, so I feel I shouldn't really try to hint at anything.

 i mean if it was even more civil than what appears there then it defo wasn't suggestive in the slightest!! i don't really think anyone would get Crazy Sexual Feelings from that unless they think you're a weirdo or they think you like her already

 Judging by how it's going so far, conversing at a university seems to be really difficult aside of the group of friends I have. Not only are a lot of people not coming to class anymore (or at least not very often), but the girl I mentioned in the Tinychat, I've only seen once. School starts again this Wednesday, but since she goes in a different class the odds aren't skyhigh I'll meet her again soon.
 
 If I do though, I'm gonna try to establish some sort of lasting contact with her. Preferably by asking her if she wants to do something after school. Wish me luck. I can't give up yet.

 Am I a wierdo? hell yeah, I was basically the school excentric.
 I dunno, considering I haven't talked to her for just about half a year (yeah, should have probably mentioned that, but that makes me seem pathetic  ) it seems kinda strange but I dunno. I'll gladly pass it off as angst though

 It's a parody of the phrase "Netflix and chill," which I believe means to watch Netflix movies and have sex.

 Where the fuck does it even come from?
 
 "Oh hey, I just heard about this sweet new show on Netflix called Daredevil! Wanna watch it?"
 "Sure!"
 
 Later...
 "God, watching this new Netflix show is making me horny!"
 "Let's chill."

 how do you not understand where it came from oss 
 it is/was just a euphemism people use/used rather than just bluntly asking "do you want to come around mine and have sex"
 
 the point is just that netflix is a pretext for what you actually are inviting them over for, not that you get horny in the middle of a netflix sesh

 IDK, Deadpool was pretty romantic.
 
 I worry too much about my crush. Not sure if it's actually too much, given the context, which I'm not about to reveal.

 In his defense you can still like someone a ton at that age and not have it be purely sexual. Y'know, "Puppy Love" as they call it.

 He did use the term "slamming" in the camp thread.

 Didn't say there was ZERO sexual motive involved.

 Confessed a little too early, I'm sure that's never happened to someone else before tho  : / It went down like "I don't see you that way, dating isn't right" but still "Let's Bee Friends" and all that... This is an awesome person who I want to hang more with, but guh now it's all awkward and stuff *angst. I am not good at dealing with this. I am unsocial, obsessive and a romantic perfectionist. (I guess we can all be, at times, tho)

 hm more Deets please. movie first dates are pretty interesting to me, because it just seems like such an impersonal place to go for a date. would absolutely never do

 pay attention to me pls

 Can't tell if it's you or them that just wanted to be friends. The "confessed" thing made me assume it was them but then you said YOU wanted to "hang"
 
 Assuming the latter, I have no idea. So this post isn't contributing anything. But just stay friends and act charming I guess 
 
 If the former, idk, don't make a big deal out of it and I assume it'll be forgotten eventually? I suck at this.

 Ah, i meant I confessed, and I want to still remain friends and hang out. The whole ordeal is, we didn't really hang out very much to begin with, even though I'd like to.
 But first of all, wow I wasn't ignored!

 Well I'm not the best person if you want social advice. Just try to contact them more frequently.

 There's not really much to do except just try to be friends, I guess. If that's what you want, then make more of an effort to hang out with no strings attached?

 we caught the train from Petrie and we talked a lot at the station, on the train and on the way to the movies
 i put my hand under the arm rest just because it felt comfortable and she held my hand and it stayed that way for the whole 2 1/2 hours. people were making jokes beforehand saying that id be focusing more on her than the movie and they were right i guess
 then we talked walking back to the station and on the train.
 i waited with her at petrie station till her parents showed up and they and her were very appreciative 
 i learnt from my sister's ex-boyfriend that you are supposed to wait with them, as he always used to just leave her whenever they went out together
 
 as I said, it went well 
 next thursday though i think im going round her uncles lakehouse for the night

 Well...I almost had my first date ever. I work for the school newspaper with a girl I like, but apparently we're not allowed to date people who work with us. She said she would do it otherwise, though.

 That's really unfortunate. Why not though?

 I guess it could cause drama in the newspaper room or some shit like that.

 What a cocksucking dumbass rule! I feel bad things turned out this way for you, Panther.

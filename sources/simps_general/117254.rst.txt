 So recently, Arthur had remade a controversial episode The Great Macgrady to erase Lance Armstrong's appearance (because that's why it's controversial but it's kind of an unfair reason, I mean yes Lance Armstrong did cheat but he was still a cancer survivor) 
 
 So if the Simpsons could remake Stark Ravin' Dad who would they replace MJ with?

 I don't think they would want to remake Stark Raving Dad, even if they just want it back on air, they could just air the original, but with many, many cuts.

 Unless if Kevin Michael Richardson decides to voice Dr. Hibbert in one of the older Simpsons episodes, unless if Alex Desert decides to voice Carl and Lou in one of the older Simpsons episodes as well, that'll probably be cool if that happens at some point

 well that wouldn't really be a problem since Hibbert wasn't even in the episode (except maybe the crowd scene but he didn't have any individual screen time)

 I once suggested (jokingly) that they could redub Michael Jackson's lines with that of Kipp Lennon. After all it won't go against their casting policies since both Kipp Lennon and Leon Kompowsky are white.

 why would they do this? their approach has clearly been to desperately pretend the episode never existed and bury it everywhere.

 Just redub it using Kevin Spacey - he's great at doing celebrity imitations.

 They're not going to go to the trouble of doing that, especially since the episode is centered around Michael Jackson. Without him, it doesn't work and the story is incomplete. 
 
 I didn't know Arthur remade that episode. I don't think that one would work without Lance Armstrong, would it?
 
 EDIT: I just looked up the Arthur episode that the OP talked about. There's no reason for the Simpsons staff to do the same thing. Hell, there was no reason to get rid of the episode to begin with, but they were just looking for approval from people who didn't care.

 According to wikipedia, there were two other Arthur episodes pulled due to the casting of Lance Armstrong. (Binky vs Binky and Room to Ride). I always wonder what they have done with the other stories that shared the same episodes (Operation D.W. and The Frensky Family Fiasco). Maybe they could combine those two as a new episode.

 Operation DW was on youtube but PBS has been blocked Arthur episodes left and right recently (Probably because they had been re-aring older episodes recently I guess we can thank the pandemic for that)
 
 they probably won't remake Room to Ride or Binky vs Binky because Great Macgrady was an episode that dealt with someone battling cancer and I don't remember what the other two episodes had that made them special, I've seen Operation DW many times combining the two would be a good idea, make it a bonus episode for the final season or something (oh yeah the show is ending soon they ended production like 3 years ago as confirmed by the actor that voiced Binky Barnes and Dave Read)

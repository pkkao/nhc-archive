<p>all my all time favorite episodes are Modern Simpsons episodes. Eternal Moonshine Of The Simpsons Mind, Holidays Of Future Passed (so much better than the overrated Lisa’s Wedding) Halloween of Horror,Barthood, Flanders’ Ladder, Way Of The Dog. Nothing from the classic era can touch these.</p>

<p>Well, those are good modern episodes…but nothing can touch the classic era. So no, I don’t find it overrated. Some episodes, sure, but I find several other classic episodes underrated, so it balances out.</p>

<p>The only one of those episodes I’ll grant you are Eternal Moonshine Of The Simpsons Mind and Halloween Of Horror. Other than that, the idea that nothing from the classic era can touch them is ridiculous. Even when it comes to Halloween Of Horror there are plenty of episodes I rate as even more amazing.
Although I disagree with the common notion that it’s only season 1-8 (9 and 10 deserve a place too), I definitely don’t think it’s overrated. Not even close. In fact, the longer the show goes on the more I will hold it dear in my heart. The Simpsons in its present state is not the yellow family comedy I fell in love with.</p>

<p>In no way I find the classic era overrated, despite liking the episodes that were mentioned (all of these are a 4, 5 or even my Modern Only 6/5), thanks to some other weaker episodes in that era.</p>

<p>Any top 50 (I would say top 100 but I’ll be lenient) episode of the classic era is miles ahead from any of the episodes You mentioned.
And no, I don’t find it overrated. I think they’re fairly rated but if anything they’re underrated given the amount of young people who think the show sucks because they’ve never watched the classic era.
Those first 8 seasons are the reason for everything else existing. They were so damn good that people could never let go until this day even when the show became a shadow of its former self. It’s like a dog who’s old, blind, deaf, has a big tumor, can barely walk and is in constant pain but You can’t let him go because of how happy you were with him in the old days.
And it’s not nostalgia, I’ve watched the classic era as an adult and I enjoyed it even more than as a kid. On the other hand I also grew up with the Scully and early Jean eras (so I should be nostalgic to those seasons as well) but they didn’t age well at all.</p>

<p>Well, I do disagree that the classic era is overrated and feel it is rather aply rated, even if there are some episodes here and there that get a bit too much praise, but overall it is definitely not something I’d call overrated. I think the episodes mentioned in the OP range from good to really good/great, but I would in no way say that any of them are better than the best of the classic era.</p>

<p>While I certainly don’t agree with OPs assertion that the best HD episodes are better than everything from the classic era, I do think they have a point about the early years being overly-venerated at times. There ARE some “meh episodes in the first nine seasons, and I would absolutely say there are a handful of post-classic episodes that are as good or better than a middling classic era episode (in fact I made a video about that!). When people act like the first decade or so of the show is completely 100% perfect and absolutely untouchable, I think it really puts the show on an unrealistic pedestal. Although I do largely agree with  &#64;Rob7 above that comparing old and new can be a fools errand anyway, since they are just so so different in terms of tone and context.</p>

<p>There are some meh episodes in the first 8 seasons but I’d say they’re not more than ten episodes. And they’re still decent.
Those first seasons were indeed that great, it’s comparable to the Beatles not having a single bad album, just a few not so great ones.
If we include season 9 in the equation things start getting a little bit shakier. That season has certainly the last bunch of truly classic episodes but also more subpar episodes than any other season until that point.</p>

<p>I don’t know about overrated or underrated, but I can honestly say I think the “Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular” has more funny lines than any of the newer episodes that he has listed.  Many of the episodes he listed have good plots, or nice moments of sentiment, but none of them (imo) are consistently funny.  I’m not saying that they are bad, I just think they appear better than they really are due to the episodes that surround them.</p>

<p>If one was to make the assertion that every episode in the classic era was a flawless masterpiece that were individually better than anything else ever produced, I would agree that that would be overrating them. That is going several steps too far.</p>
<p>However, in the context of the era having consistently high quality, holding up as entertaining television that is rightfully praised for its humour and storytelling, and generally better than pretty much anything that comes in what’s come to be defined as the post-classic era, I would say that’s a fair assertion and not overrating it at all.</p>

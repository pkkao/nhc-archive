<p>Tbh I may have put off sex until 23 because I truly believed that’d be the last teenage thing left and could already feel like glow waning from the relationships I had back when I was naive.</p>
<p>Sex was resoundingly meh, and believe me, we knew what we were doing.</p>

<p>Somehow I don’t think anyone’s first time is ever THAT great. I’ve certainly never heard a story of a first time that wasn’t at least somewhat awkward or uncomfortable. Like, the best you can hope for is probably “Meh” even if you aren’t some stupid teenager, because you build up so much in your head that it’ll be amazing, yet you’ll also fear it going as poorly as possible. “Meh” is actually an okay middle ground from that perspective.</p>

<p>Trust me, I was far too drunk to fear anything even subconsciously. The first time was the best out of the three times. Went on the longest. Think I stretched my anus out a bit much after that and his cock’s just not wide enough.</p>

<p>but this is more about aging and losing the desire to even be infatuated or have a crush. It’s a lot of influx of cyncism and world-weariness…</p>
</div>
<p>For what it’s worth I feel the same way. My first relationship was a lot more scary and fun in many ways than my second, partly because it was all new but mostly because I was more into the person I was with the first time around than I was with the second person. Not sure how to recapture the intensity of those feelings with a new person.</p>
<p>I do like the guy I’ve just met, in a sort of “hey you’re a cool new person who’s also kind of cute” sort of way, and it’s kind of nice that we started speaking to each other just out of the blue. Not sure what if anything will come of it, but if we stay friends or become something that would be nice. I guess it’s odd that I’m already thinking that something might happen eventually with a person I just met a couple days ago, but both of my relationships started from just chance conversations and meetings, so there is that.</p>
<p>Between this and Panther’s shit-smelling kink, I suddenly no longer have any fears as to the TMI-ness of stuff I could post.  Seconding the RIP for your bootyhole, though.</p>

<p>&#64;Torrens there was once a time when this board discussed their sex lives (Or lack thereof)  to what some would likely describe as “Aggravatingly frequently”. For a lot of us who were around during that time there’s probably very little that could be said at this point that would be that jarring of an overshare.</p>

<p>I felt brave enough today that I asked someone at work if she wanted to do something afterwards. She said she’ll think about it, which is kind of a non-answer, but at least I did it. We talked enough today that i felt I was able to do it.</p>

<p>Just be careful with work relationships. I recently watched some coworkers at one of my workplaces trash their careers really fast as they let their relationship get in the way of being professional. One of them was an assistant manager, on his way up to having his own store in a matter of time. 23 years old, also has a kid to care for. Then a 17-year-old coworker ends up single, they end up in bed, and they eventually just stopped showing up to work. That’s when they both got fired.</p>

<p>That’s… probably very rare. Most statistics I’ve seen show that people actually work better when they have a crush on a work colleague, since it makes them happier and more entusiastic. What you are describing sounds very uncommon.</p>

<p>I honestly doubt those statistics. It mainly depends on the situation and where you’re from. The worst thing is, nobody wants to think of the worst-case scenario ahead of time in planning something that looks like a good thing. I do, and that’s why I’ll probably never have a girlfriend. My biggest fear is what happens after the breakup, which implies there will be one, not that I am desiring one.</p>
<p>At work, it’s something to look forward to when you get to know people, but getting into a professional/personal relationship just usually doesn’t mix well. After the breakup, one usually leaves work. Knowing the job market here in America, I’d prefer not to trash my source of income for a coworker. Not to mention, what would the employer say when I look for a job elsewhere?</p>

<p>Hiding your feelings in fear of getting fired sounds far worse, and will make going to work not worth it anyway. I’d say it’s better to take the risk for potential happiness than not doing it and risk falling into a state of depression. You should obviously not let it get completely over your head and just start skipping work like your colleagues did, but repressing your emotions doesn’t help either.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ve seen too many romantic movies, but I’m just trying to tell you that there’s hope for pretty much anyone (who wants to) to find someone to share their feelings with. You get into some tough struggles, which I still do, but there is still always hope. Life is a mix of the unpredictable and what you make it. The question is… Are you willing to try and make it more than let “fate” decide for you?</p>

<p>I didn’t think of repressing emotions, but I meant more to just find a way to let the idea go. It’s my maxim not to date any coworker unless I have permanently left the workplace.</p>

<p>I’m willing to believe people have more enthusiasm at work when they crush on / casually flirt with a coworker. However, I don’t think actually dating is a great idea until one of you has left the company. If anything, because both the good and the bad of it constitutes an unhealthy level of distraction for the couple and anyone else witnessing their necking / fighting.</p>
<p>Tbh I’d ban overt relationships in work and school before I’d ban “distracting” hairstyles. If you’re able to pursue it without ramming the ins and outs of the relationship down everyone else’s throat, I’d say the couple maybe has the maturity to date someone from work/school.</p>

<p>Because you’re INFATUATED. It is a crush. You are almost always happier and more enthusiastic when your crush has anything to do with anything. You were more than happy to sit on a couch for 2 hours.</p>
<p>And the SECOND anything goes sour with your coworker, guess what!!</p>

<p>Wait, didn’t you guys have a whole thing before? Like, dating and stuff? I remember bad superhero movies being involved and her having some family issues so like… if she’s still giving you signs of interest after all that then what is there to fear other than rejection?</p>

<p>yeah me and her have hung out in the past and whatever and we did date but i think i was the only one who kept feelings</p>
<p>well that’s until like today when it seemed like she was flirting with me
and yeah i don’t mind if i end up rejected again, we’re kinda in completely different circles in terms of friends so if i got rejected i’m sure everything will be alright</p>
<p>i do like her though, a whole lot
i might keep that a bit under wraps cus it’ll make her think she can make me do whatever</p>

<p>Letting someone know that you like them shouldn’t be you effectively renouncing ownership of a backbone. If they really are who you see them as then that shouldn’t change because you opted to let your guard down. If she tries to manipulate you into doing stuff for that you’re uncomfortable with under such reasoning as “I thought you liked/loved me”, at that point you might as well say “That’s funny, I thought so too” because I’m willing to bet you like Ella for may reasons but her attempting to toy with your emotions for her own gain isn’t one of them.</p>

ive just had it happen before
and ella does seem pretty manipulative sometimes</p>
<p>i like her a lot because of how similar she is to me in terms of sense of humour and just way of being. i’m hoping that perspective doesn’t shift if it turns out she likes me back</p>

<p>If you can tell when she’s being manipulative then that really ought to be your cue to speak up. It’ll feel shitty and it won’t go smoothly but you’ll ultimately be better off in the long run for not being her lackey with benefits.</p>

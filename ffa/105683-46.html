<p>Y’know, I’ve never watched any stalker shows on TLC. Perhaps someone here ore knowledgeable than myself on the subject could shed some light. Has there ever been one where the stalker actually gets the person they want and they live happily ever after? I mean, given that OSS is the one who made that poll option, I assume he’s watched some of them and lord knows may have even found them inspiring. Can’t imagine why he’d think what he’s doing is a good course of action unless he’s seen something similar on TV play out with positive results.</p>

<p>stalking in the way OSS is, is quite (dare I say normal) for a teenager, if he was any older I’d be warning this poor girl to avoid the hairy guy on the couch at all costs</p>

<p>I was the cringiest lovelorn teenager you’ll ever see and I stopped doing this level of dumb shit at 13/14 ffs.</p>
<p>(Never put that much effort into effectively stalking someone though from what I remember.)</p>

<p>It’s not normal even for teenagers. I had two stalkers through my teen years and most people were plenty aware it was not ok, even if I did get asked idiot questions like “Well did you make sure they know you aren’t interested? Did you maybe lead them on?”</p>

<p>Yeah. I have the tendencies to behave that way but at the age I am now I don’t actually do it. So I say as an ex creepy teenager, it is not normal behaviour. It might be a relatively normal thought process, but you have to filter your actions.</p>

<p>Give me some serious advice on an easier way to reach her, which is really all I want right now. No more stalker comments, no more “give it a break” comments. Tell me a good way to be able to talk to her which is better than what I’m doing in the current situation.</p>

<p>You don’t know anything about her except that YOU find her attractive. You are not considering anyone else in this situation but yourself. Please move on. You could have talked to so, so many new people by now.</p>

<p>OSS mate unless you happen to be in a situation where you both happen randomly upon each other and either she talks to you or you unintentionally (emphasising the “un” here) bump into her or vice versa that can naturally result in small talk, there is literally nothing else that you can do that wouldn’t be extremely creepy and stalker-ish.</p>

<p>Don’t get fixated on this girl. It’s not love, you don’t know her. Focus your attention on other things and someone will come along. When you look at couples they generally meet via work, shared classes or through other friends. It happens naturally, just put yourself into situations where you’re interacting with new people. That’s the answer really. Fixating on this girl isn’t fair on her and it’s not healthy for you. If you happen to bump into her then sure, make an effort, maybe ask her out if you click. But people aren’t going to give you advice on how to force your way into her life.</p>

<p>Can you not inbox her on Facebook or something with a trivial question about something that you’ve maybe discussed before and just try to get a conversation flowing naturally? if that goes on for a bit, then you get her number, then you arrange to meet up, then we get oss jr.</p>

<p>ah okay then, I thought he at least knew her a little bit because earlier in the thread he mentioned he’d spoke to her/given her his number. if you know her last name, i’d send her a friend request on facebook. i think something small like that could get things moving a little bit in a much more appropriate way rather than having to confine yourself to a couch for 3 hours. she’d see it and be like “oh yeah, that guy!”, that could lead to a message off her or even just give you something to mention next time you bump into her. just gotta keep things moving, even if its in a negative way cause then at least you know where you stand. it’s better for her to tell you she’s not interested, block you on facebook, never text you and have yourself hurt for a short time rather than have her never know you exist. because what’s the point in that? you’re just delaying the inevitable of nothing evolving.</p>
<p>but as others have said, this is really a vague background thing you should be doing in your life. this should not be your primary focus, not even relationship-wise, so don’t build it up too much in your head. have fun with the friends and girls you do know! if you don’t know any, speak to the people in your classes and get to know more people (this is easier said than done for some people of course but you seem to be okay/confident with socialising with people). improve things generally in all directions and more opportunity should arrive.</p>

<p>Look OSS not that I want you to even go anywhere near this girl now or anything but usually when one doesn’t know something about someone else in a school or a business or just anywhere, they ask others. It is a school. Many people must interact with this girl. SOMEONE has to know her. It would be logical to briefly ask others there if they happen to know her or see her. And I don’t mean going up to the main office and trying to get all the info you can on her or grilling other students about details. Just quick, easy queries. This is how I’ve figured out who ANYONE in my life was before Facebook even existed.</p>
<p>Consider this the next time you become infatuated with someone you don’t know.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, if you actually want a girlfriend/boyfriend and not a meaningless hook up, you have to be completely genuine with the person. Finding someone to be with isn’t just about having someone you can brag about and smoosh genitals with, it needs to be someone you are comfortable and honest with, someone that you can enjoy your time with, and you can’t have that without being yourself. And if you aren’t ready to just be you, you aren’t ready to have a girlfriend or boyfriend. If you’re in a relationship because you just want a relationship, it isn’t going to be a happy one. Yeah, having someone to share your time with is great, but it’s not that great if you aren’t happy.</p>
<p>Forcing stuff isn’t going to help anyone, it just makes you seem weird and desperate. Just LET IT HAPPEN. If things don’t come about through a natural course, it probably isn’t meant to happen. Basically everyone talking about this stuff is quite young anyway, this is not the end of your dating life if something doesn’t happen in the next few months. Calm down and go with the flow. You will be less stressed and less terrifying to anyone you are interested in.</p>

<p>you meant when you don’t have to learn how to talk with women? that’s true but It’s not “talking to women” that is the crux, it’s letting desirable women know that you’re up for  that people want to hax, and what I assume zach meant no one requires advice for

<p>Snowpit should stop posting whenever he get anxious because that hurt to read.
Panther should not basse his future on whether or not he can abide by internet ruele.</p>

<p>For God’s sake, what happened to giving straight answers?!</p>
<p>I took  &#64;Godot’s advice yesterday and did use the word “date” when asking the girl at work out. I even memotioned ice skating, for Christ’s sake.</p>
<p>Her answer to it? “I don’t know”.</p>
<p>“I DON’T KNOW” IS NOT A FUCKING ANSWER! Even “maybe” is more of an answer!</p>
<p>I swear to God I’m so fucking unlucky I can’t believe it. It doesn’t matter how many times I show courage or how well I do it, I am ALWAYS. SCREWED OVER.</p>

<p>I’m stressing myself out trying to finish their Christmas present so I can go catch up with them tomorrow when they come to the next city. Just found out I might not be seeing my mother, and might not be able to get my post <em>even though I’m the out of hours contact for the entire building and stuck here over Christmas</em>. I should go, shouldn’t I? Without guilting them about all of the above. Seeing them would be the highlight of my week, easily.</p>

<p>OSS if any potential girl 4 u saw the mini tantrum you are throwing over an “I don’t know” then you may just be screwed.</p>
<p>You really need to relax. You’re not unlucky. I mean I know your Discord label is Sex Machine, but you are not that. Do not expect every single girl who walks your way to be captivated and want and need to date you because of superficial reasons such as simply asking. You’re not unlucky because each attempt hasn’t stuck. You straight up just haven’t found the right person yet. That doesn’t just mean finding someone willing to say “yes” but it means finding someone willing to stay onboard after that first “yes” and spending more than a few hours / days with you.</p>
<p>But I mean also…coworker.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>OSS you did all you could, luv. And what kupo said. Don’t let them know how much it bothers you. Move on to someone who’s interested, and if you genuinely really like the girl, maybe talk to her a few more times without trying to set something up, find some common ground and ask again. It’s reasonable to ask again if you actually want to be her friend; it’s only weird if you show no signs of genuine friendship and just want to date her.</p></li>

<p>Recently been reading a book called Cringe which is basically just excerpts from people’s teenage diaries and poetry from the 70s to the 00s. I promise that reading that from the distance of even mid twenties tells me there’s no need to freak out.</p>

<p>I’m in this situation. We were all like “Let’s bee friends”, and ofc I want to be her friend! but I also wanna date her.
I have trouble distinguishing the difference. Is it dishonest/immoral if I talk to and do things with her as a friend, but while I obviously still wanna date her?
Like if I ask myself “Whould I try to hangout with her if I weren’t into her romantically?”, the answer is a definite “No, what do you think you are, a social person?” and then it seems dishonest.
If I ask someself “Whould I like to hang out (…)” though, the answer is yes. The way I see it, that’s a reason to. (But obviously I’m biased)</p>

<p>It’s dishonest if you have 0 interest in her once it is known there’s no chance for dating. After all, many out there tend to be friends before dating. If you are ONLY there for the prospect of dating, like you ONLY pay attention to her now because you might wanna be intimate down the line, it seems a bit scummy. Like I mean it’s fine to realize your own personal emotional/mental state and realize you’re not super social and probably wouldn’t be putting yourself out there otherwise. However, I think you would kinda know if you enjoy this person’s company for reasons other than “we might kiss later” or whatever. It’s hard to see past your own issues and demons sometimes, but those finer nuances of a real friendship become more clear when the time and effort is put in to simply exist with each other on good terms vs. a footrace to get someone to say a big fat “yes.”</p>

<p>That’s wise. I mean, at least it’s what I want to hear : P
I’ve always considered to be good friends to be a prerequisite to dating, I’m not really the one-night stand guy. I mean, we weren’t when I asked her and that was wrong: I really feel like I haven’t ever been myself before her, and that we would want to be better friends than we are. (I may not be very social, but I’m somewhat confident in that impression)
(That and that I did end up asking her out is a slightly more personal and convoluted story though :&lt; )</p>
<p>It’s a very soothing way to think “I’ll try wholeheartedly to make sure if we could be good friends, and if not, she’s obviously not right for me anyway”.
So that’s what I’ll be doing.
I want that so badly too!</p>

<p>“No, who do you think you are, a social person?”</p>
<p>I’m also in this situation. Friend knows exactly how I feel. I’m not the only one who feels so strongly about them, but perhaps more easily tolerated than others because I’m sensitive to what they want/need. I can 100% say that even though I feel differently about this person than I do other people, I definitely would want to hang out with them if I weren’t romantically interested. And I’m asocial as hell. The person makes the difference, in more ways than just a crush. That… is how you know you found a real good friend. It defies the normal rules of how you’re willing to relate to someone.</p>

<p>Man, this sure is an aggressively British euphemism for fucking someone that I haven’t heard since I was in my teens. Thanks for the unexpected memories there.</p>
<p>Gay answers are generally better anyway tbh.</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, this “Woe is me” self-pity victim complex thing you have going on isn’t exactly the most attractive attitude. It’s actually entitled to a really gross degree. It’s making you sound like a Nice Guy™  which… yeah, don’t be one of those. They suck ass.</p>
<p>Also, what people consider “Courageous” is gonna wildly vary from person to person so uh… maybe don’t put all your eggs in one basket and assume that just because you had the stones to ask someone out means they’re gonna fuckin’ swoon over you? TBH, the “Look at how courageous I am” thing is some real faux bravado, toxic masculinity shit.</p>
<p>Just be who you are and try not to place too much importance on finding someone, because the longer it takes the more you’re gonna drive yourself insane over it.</p>

<p>Saw my crush today. We went out for lunch. Couple of throwaway statements we agreed on, like if we were normal we’d have had so much sex when we lived close to each other. We agree on a lot of things. I feel so hollow. I want this to be more.</p>
<p>Also found out the guy I was sorta seeing has been telling everyone what we did together. I couldn’t really care less, because I don’t love him. But although mediocre, safe, consensual sex is nothing to be ashamed of at 23, it’s hardly an achievement that’ll impress anybody. Fortunately his friends thought “So what?”</p>

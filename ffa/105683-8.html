<p>Ok, I need to get this out to SOMEONE, and it might as well be to you mostly anonymous lovable weirdos. Of the forums I visit, I feel like you guys are the least likely to give me a hard time about this.</p>
<p>I am in a very very very committed relationship. I am also extremely jealous and insecure to the point of psychosis, though I am significantly better than I was several years ago. I mean, with other exes, it would be a huge deal and send me into panic attacks and episodes of crippling depression if I noticed them look at another girl or even mention that they found a Hollywood actress attractive. I’ve got a lot of body image and abandonment issues. (Thankfully, though, I have learned to differentiate my issues from my legitimate values, i.e. flipping out over a quick glance is a personal issue but flipping out over your SO ogling someone else is justified)</p>
<p>So all that said… I have realized I have a little crush on this really cute girl who works at the thrift store we go to. I feel so guilty, like I’m the biggest hypocrite in the world–and I am–yet I don’t avoid her or so anything to make it go away. It’s not like we can go to a new thrift store anyway, but I also don’t want to. She’s kind, pretty, cheerful, helpful, we both get excited over the same kinds of cool finds. I have no idea if she’s lesbian, straight, bi, pan, asexual… she hits my radar as bi.</p>
<p>I think Mr. Paddlin has no idea. In fact, I think he sees us talking and just gets happy that I might be making a friend (I am very shy and reclusive). I try to only talk to her when he’s across the store, but of course a lot of times he’ll come up to the front and I won’t notice and then I get all flustered because a) I feel like a little girl getting caught doing something bad, b) I feel completely awful about it, and c) I know this is terrible but… I don’t want her to get the wrong impression and think I’m straight.</p>
<p>The Mr. and I have talked about threesomes before, and he’s told me that while just like anyone else, he finds the idea completely hot, he thinks at his age now the actual mechanics sound kinda exhausting, plus it’s enough pressure to make sure <em>one</em> partner gets off. He’s said that for most of the couples he’s known who went and tried doing a threeway, it eventually became a huge problem in some way and severely damaged their relationship. One person would realize they had jealousy issues, or one person would suddenly want them constantly, or it would just be this emotional disaster. The only couples who seemed able to pull it off were either in open relationships or polyamorous. Lastly, we <em>both</em> have jealousy issues (or so he tells me?) and he says that he doesn’t want to share me with anyone really and he especially doesn’t want <em>that</em> to be the moment he realizes he’s jealous of guys AND girls.</p>
<p>But… for a long time, I have felt like polyamory might actually be for me. The two people in my life needn’t be together, but should at least have a bond over me. I am a pretty damaged person who needs a LOT of love and care AND I also have endless amounts of love to give and work tirelessly to please the people I love and care about. I know what I want and need out of a relationship: the be nurtured, babied, protected, loved, to have my inner child and mental age respected, to be given respect and patience, and to be given discipline, boundaries, motivation, and encouragement. Most people think they know what they <em>want</em> out of a relationship, but they don’t know what they <em>need</em>.</p>
<p>I don’t know. 99.99999% chance nothing will come of it. Just feeling ultra guilty, thinking about what could be, and wanting to get it out to <em>someone</em></p>

<p>I don’t think you should feel guilty but should maybe just talk to him about it more to ease your mind, if necessary. I mentioned my major crush before in this thread (my college classmate whom I spent lots of free time with), but I was terrible about hiding my excitement whenever I hung out with her, so my husband caught on fairly quick to the fact that I WAS crushing on her. However, his reaction was not disappointment or anger, but supportive, positive. Hell, he was close to trying to convince her to make out w/ me at our grad party but that would’ve been strange w/ family there. Pretty sure she is straight, tho. Anyway, I am quite introverted and do not seek or make friends in person very easily (he is always trying to get me to call people or take them up on offers to go out) and she was essentially my best friend at the time, so that probably helped him just be like “All right, I can see that.”  I knew there was no chance with her, he probably knew there was no chance, so crushing on my friend was really just caring for her a lot. I mean, if I have to be TMI here, we always talk about the idea of three-ways and junk (with girls, he doesn’t like the idea of guys and that’s fine with me) for the mutual flirty fun but we both know we’d never be able to go through with it because we’re far too committed and possessive of each other. But just being able to talk/fantasize about it is a nice outlet/alternative to actually jeopardizing our relationship. Talking a lot helps a lot. Probably sounds strange but he boards here so I’m sure he could corroborate this if he needed to.</p>

<p>If you’re hiding it, it’s a big deal to you and if it’s a big deal to you it will be a big deal to him. Literally just talk about your needs and feelings. Hiding makes it worse and being in the dark can less you to do regrettable things.</p>

<p>I don’t ever have serious crushes on anyone because my standards are too high.  Almost everything turns me off.  And because I am extremely shy and barely ever talk to anyone, my best chance to have a relationship seems to be online dating.  I actually found someone who interested me, and we started talking online and became (online) friends.  That was the only serious crush I ever had, and I was pretty open about the way I felt (although it was pretty easy because I knew we both wanted a relationship, otherwise we wouldn’t have both been on the online dating website).  I don’t know how I would act if I had a serious crush on someone I knew in person, because that has never happened to me.</p>

<p>online dating is good for those who have social anxieties but do remember that at one point he’ll ask you out and you’ll have to interact in person. don’t say yes unless you’re 100% comfortable with that.</p>

<p>Yes, I hate it, but it exponentially increases my chances of getting a relationship (not that it has resulted in very much so far).  Having all that information about myself online makes me nervous, but the potential rewards are worth the risk (and I don’t actually have a lot of information up, but it still makes me nervous).</p>

<p>The thing about online dating that I found good was that you’re sorta stuck having to pay attention to each other. You can’t get physical and unless you video chat, you tend to not put too much gravity/importance towards appearances and looks so much as you just care about what you are talking about. You have to communicate, you are FORCED to communicate, and it strengthened my relationship (and, you know, communication skills) a ton. It’s like seeing the real person inside all the time and connecting directly with that person. Of course, this is assuming you are talking to someone sincere and if that person is not sincere, it is not the fault of “online dating,” but the fault of the idiot who isn’t being truthful. This is where phone chatting comes in handy because it brings you closer and on a more personal level than text based chatting. Then you do have to build up the confidence of meeting in person but if your relationship/friendship online is strong, it shouldn’t be too much of a thing. For us it just instantly clicked. We got over the nervous pleasantries over dinner and went late night shopping for cereal or something after and it was all like normal, like it should be.</p>
<p>I mean obviously this can all be done in person, too, as I did with my ex but when you have massive anxieties (or physical ailments like I had at the time, severe peak of my chronic eczema which was wholly unattractive but my husband didn’t mind at the time because he rocks), online dating is a perfectly viable option.  You will meet crappy people online you don’t mesh with - the same can happen in real life. Either way it’s all about how you approach it, being aware of what is being put out there as far as info or red flags, and knowing that there is a possibility that you will have to actually craft a relationship over a steady period of time and it might not just fall in your lap like nothing.</p>

<p>The online dating thing is highly popular in my area (whole country infact since the population is tiny). So finding someone wouldn’t be a huge problem that way, but im not so sure if i need a relationship at this time. Also i kinda like the idea of randomly meeting or she meeting me, rather than purposely searching for one.</p>

<p>True that. I mainly meant those specifically “dating sites” and don’t think i would ever want to use those to purposely seek for someone. But if i randomly met someone online, on some forum or social media site, wherever that would be and became close, then that i’d be fine with i think. But im not exactly drawn to relationships at this point.</p>

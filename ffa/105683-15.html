<p>Chicks dig when you draw a card yourself, OSS, but don’t put a nude Timson on it or anything. Better post your drawing here first so we can tell you if it’s appropriate to give it to her. Good idea?</p>

<p>FINALLY Oss is going on that date. Good for you. Now close the deal. Just have fun.</p>
<p>Kupo is probably the best judge on whether the card would be adorable to receive. Maybe some other girls can chip in. If I had to give a suggestion, I’d say when you draw someone, always look if you’ve drawn elements elegant enough. Since a drawing is a kind of mirror, some people can be very sensitive to that stuff. So yeah, fix the lumpy space boobs a bit. Good luck</p>

<p>I showed her the card today (I didn’t know where I’d print it out in full color, so I just did it in the chat) and she loved it. She didn’t say “Cute, but I just want to stay friends or anything”, she was just happy over the card I gave her. It was great timing too, since she had worked with handing out commercial flyers, and since she hates her job, she wasn’t feeling well. So I cheered her up.</p>

<p>Are you telling me that all this time, if I wanted to get a date, all I had to do is make the girl a card on MS paint?</p>

<p>Hahaha
Well, we have known each other since about late August/September after all, so I definitely wouldn’t have made the card if I hadn’t been in love with her so long and wasn’t sure if there would be no risks. Sure I could have fucked up like I’ve done with earlier crushes, but this time I really tried the hardest not to.</p>

<p>I  don’t see her anymore, since we aren’t in any classes together. I did run into her in the hall recently, but she was in a hurry, so we could only exchange greetings and quick pleasantries.</p>

<p>I have a question: If I want a girlfriend, am I required to know how to do the flirting thing? Because I just read this, and if I have to know how to do all that, I’m never getting one.</p>

<p>Girl: I love thongs.
Guy: I’ll bet you look great in a thong.</p>
<p>Ugh. There’s no mystery there; no challenge. By being direct and obvious, this guy’s robbed this exchange of all its fun. Here’s the flirtatious man’s more subtle response:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Girl: I love thongs.
Guy: Thongs do have a very nice way of accenting the female form.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And another take on a reply using subtlety in response to the same statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Girl: I love thongs.
Guy: Oh really? Well, believe it or not, I love girls who love thongs.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I’m dying</p>

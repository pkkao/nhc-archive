Man, who would’ve thought you could look forward to Wednesday more than Friday?</p>

<p>I don’t get crushes very often, but when I do I just get really nervous and often feel dumb and unworthy of that person’s attention. I’ll even act extra shy and awkward around them because I am always afraid what they think of me and I just feel dumb mostly…I’ll never go up to them or ask them out or anything because honestly I have no clue how to do any of that stuff without looking like an idiot. Usually just assume they’re taken or want nothing to do with me either since I feel like i’m never worthy of anyone’s attention (let alone a male that i’m attracted to). Even so, the though of any guy ever being interested in me just seems foreign and impossible to me to comprehend. I feel like i’ll forever be alone because of this never ending cycle of self pity and social awkwardness. I know nobody will ever approach me either and it still baffles me how anybody ever gets together because I feel like it’s impossible for me to ever meet anyone let alone make new friends or anything close to something romantic.</p>

<p>Sometimes, on the occasions that a guy has liked me back, I’ve actually flirted with him under the pretense that we may start dating….then once I have him, I decide I’m not interested anymore and let him down. Shitty I know, but I don’t fell compelled to go beyond that point.</p>

<p>I’ve decided that I should take it a little cool. If I ask her too many times if she wants to do something, she’ll grow tired of hearing it and not want to. I shouldn’t pressure her.
One thing I’ve noticed is that I try so desperately to make her laugh that I use VERY dry humor. It’s starting to feel more and more painful and I wish I just could think up easier ways of getting the conversation going.
Otherwise, I’m fine. I’m glad I even get to speak with her without any issue and I’m always happy to be around her. All I need is patience.
However, should I ask her if we can keep contact when it’s the last lesson and fall break arrives, or should I take it even easier and just TRY REALLY FUCKING HARD waiting till school starts again?</p>

<p>Plain and simple, if she isn’t interested in you, there isn’t really anything you can do to make her like you.</p>

I didn’t say she wasn’t interested in me. I don’t know what she thinks about me yet. I said I was fine with the situation as it is.</p>

<p>To be honest I haven’t really had any serious crushes, but if there is a girl I like I just try to be more confident and funnier than usual. Which has not been successful considering that my stats are this: girls I like(d) who like(d) me - 0, girls I don’t/didn’t like who like(d) me - 2, girls banged - 0.</p>

<p>I’ve decided that I should take it a little cool. If I ask her too many times if she wants to do something, she’ll grow tired of hearing it and not want to. I shouldn’t pressure her.
One thing I’ve noticed is that I try so desperately to make her laugh that I use VERY dry humor. It’s starting to feel more and more painful and I wish I just could think up easier ways of getting the conversation going.
Otherwise, I’m fine. I’m glad I even get to speak with her without any issue and I’m always happy to be around her. All I need is patience.
However, should I ask her if we can keep contact when it’s the last lesson and fall break arrives, or should I take it even easier and just TRY REALLY FUCKING HARD waiting till school starts again?</p>
</div>
<p>Have you ever done anything together then, or is she always busy, later etc?</p>
<p>If yes and you have done something together and she seemed to enjoy your company, then i see no harm in asking to keep in contact.</p>

<p>We’ve only seen each other at math and she seems to enjoy my company, but she has always said “We’ll talk about it later” or “We’ll see”. I think it just is that she still doesn’t know me that well yet and is unsure.</p>

<p>Sweet, I met her today coincidentally while on my short break before another lesson.
We only talked for a few minutes, but it was still worth it. Apparently she studies latin, by the way
I also saw her later walking down the stairs, but she was probably just going to begin a lesson and I didn’t want to seem like I had been following her (even though I wouldn’t have), so I skipped. But I still got to talk with her!</p>

<p>I had math, so I once again saw her. Delightful as usual! Even better when I also saw her afterwards going somewhere. I just looked at her and smiled, so she smiled back and said “Hi” with her lips. (She didn’t really speak, I just knew what she said)
Still wondering if I should ask her to keep in touch or not, though. It’s a math test next week and that day, I don’t think there will be time where we can talk with each other, since there also will be a fall break the following week after that.</p>

<p>I tend to act skiddish if I’m near someone I like, which is bad, because I get clumsy when I’m like that. More often than not, I end up unintentionally making myself look like an idiot in front of them.</p>

<p>So far, it appears that the first part of that little attention-seeking tango works better than the second.</p>

<p>So you’re saying that people should openly have affairs with other people and their partners are expected to forgive them and just deal with it every time? Huh</p>
<p>There’s a kind of trust you have if you’re in a relationship, and finding out that your partner is having an affair would completely break that trust.</p>

<p>So there was a girl in my class two semesters ago that MIGHT have shown interest in me, and I never even crossed my mind that she might have been asking me out until my mom spelled it out for me. I missed my chance with her, if there ever was one, but since she doesn’t go to my school anymore, I just sent her this text message to learn the truth once and for all!</p>
<p>“Hi Kelsey, it’s J.T. I see that you go to KU now, so I think it’s safe to ask you this question that’s been eating at me for the last six months or so: Were you interested in me romantically? Before you scream in disgust, hear me out: On the last day of the CPR class, you asked if I wanted to get lunch. I didn’t really think anything of it for a while and casually mentioned it to my mom one day. She replied, “WHAT? That sounds like a date to me!” And then I thought, “Huh…maybe it was. I mean, Kelsey seemed to like to talk to me in class, and she smiled at me a lot. I think I’ve read that those were signs.” So after learning that, I tried to organize the meetup again, but it never really panned out. So I have to know: Were you sort of asking me on a  date, or was it just a “friends” thing? Please be honest; I want to use this information as a learning experience to see if I’m able to tell if a girl is showing interest in me.”</p>

<p>You told me how you didn’t have many friends and I remember what that was like. I never meant for it to be a date. I really just want to be friends. Is there any movies that you want to see?</p>

<p>I don’t necessarily have a crush on her, but if she wanted to go on a date with me, I’d love it. I was told to let people know what she said, so I did. Where did I say it was horrible that she wants to be my friend?</p>

<p>some shit is going on right now in my life… remember way back when i mentioned a guy i was developing a crush on and i was pretty sure he liked me as well? well it’s taken some major developments in the last month.</p>
<p>i’ve gradually been becoming closer and closer friends with this guy. during the christmas holidays when we went back home from uni for a while, we promised that we would spend some days at each other home’s. we finally did this last week, and in the end we spent about five days straight with each other. since we went back to uni we’ve spent almost every night with each other (bear in mind that we don’t currently live together so we’re actually going out of our way to see each other) - and obviously i’ve found this a little odd. like, why does he want to see me so much? you don’t normally spend every night with the same friend unless you have a strong attachment to them.</p>
<p>flash forward to yesterday. i use the app called yik yak (which if you didn’t know, is basically a social networking app where you can make anonymous messages about anything in a mile radius), and i kind of got this guy to use it as well. and i noticed this message today that said something like “it’s been 2 days since i saw my best friend and i miss him already”. it’s certainly a message from him. and i’ve noticed lately that he’s becoming closer to me physically all the time.</p>
<p>now this has fucked me up quite a bit… our friendship has been developing at a ridiculous speed since we first met four months ago, and it’s fucking obvious that he has a strong emotional attachment to me. and the great thing is that i love him as well and he is by far my best friend. and the fact that we want to see each other every night and have strong feeling for each other… it’s kind of messing with my mind to be honest.</p>
<p>so yeah… i have no clue what i’m gonna fucking do. i feel lucky to be in this position with someone and i’m kinda excited to see what happens, though i’m fucking nervous as well.</p>
<p>i’d really appreciate some help and guidance with this.</p>

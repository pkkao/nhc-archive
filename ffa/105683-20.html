<p>Well, she is trying out her new job this weekend, but she says that if she’s not exhausted, sunday afternoon will be fine.
I don’t know what I’m worried about the most, the fact that I feel so tempted to tell her I love her if we meet or the possible cancellation of our date.</p>

<p>You probably shouldn’t tell someone you aren’t steadily in a relationship with that you love them.</p>
<p>I mean that’s exactly what turned me off my husband when we met and why it took him 3 years to wrangle me back in.</p>
<p>If she’s tired and cancels on whatever you guys have planned, respect that and reschedule. And offer an ear to hear about how it all went.</p>

<p>Yeah, I don’t exactly want to be all “Damn it, why not” to her. I do hope we meet up this weekend, but if it’s cancelled, I’ll have to relax and let it wait for another day.
To be honest, I’m really not quite certain where this all is going.</p>

<p>Well that tends to be how relationships go, sir, especially when they are just on the cusp of beginning</p>
<p>You don’t need to know where it’s going to go, though. Not right now, anyway. If you like her as much as you say you do, then you will enjoy your time together regardless of where it goes. A lot of people care too much about where it will go at the START. You should be focusing more about making whatever it is going on now special for the moment, so that there’s a future to even think about at all. Live in the now for the time being and focus on making each other happy. That will help clear up where things are going later, when you need to know.</p>
<p>Not saying this is going to be you, but I’ve been an ear to just countless teen dating issues so one trend I’ve noticed…the guy fusses about how badly he wants to know whether or not all the nice things he is doing is “worth” it. That’s kind of a rotten way to go about a relationship with any human being. People befriending other people only because of a crush and want to date them. Once they say no to dating, the contact is cut off and now they’re not even friends. But “she makes me so happy and I love her” they used to say, when they thought they could get somewhere</p>
<p>You don’t want to be that frustrating person. Because that person is insanely frustrating and very insincere. And that person can let that insecurity of needing to know if a relationship/sex/whatever will happen cloud their actions. They get impatient or increasingly negative because the other person isn’t saying anything about dating steadily yet and that throws a wrench in the whole thing.</p>
<p>But I mean if you LIKE her, you can TELL her that you like her. It may very well speed things along. But I strongly advise against saying “love.”</p>

<p>What’s the problem with the phrase “I love you”? I’ve seen a couple times in TV shows when people are making out and the guy says “I love you,” and suddenly the girl hates him. If you’re making out/fucking, isn’t it pretty obvious that you’re in love?</p>

<p>What’s the problem with the phrase “I love you”? I’ve seen a couple times in TV shows when people are making out and the guy says “I love you,” and suddenly the girl hates him. If you’re making out/fucking, isn’t it pretty obvious that you’re in love?</p>
</div>
<p>Uh Panther we had known each other all of 3 months when he told me and we didn’t even live in the same state. You tell a girl you haven’t really spend a great deal of time with, intimate or not, that you “love” her and red flags tend to go up. That’s what the problem is here.</p>
<p>And NO making out and fucking =/= love automatically, not even close. You can fuck or suck face with anyone who is willing and not have to love them. Even if you’re dating, you don’t need to be in love to just DO or consent to doing any of that. That is why there is something special about, you know, actually loving and committing to the person you do these things with all the time. It’s more intimate and means far more to the people involved. And that’s why it’s so painful when that person you love cheats on you that way.</p>
<p>Otherwise TV is stupid please just ignore TV. I don’t know what you were watching but it sounds like something that would happen in Degrassi.</p>

<p>You are right kupo, I should probably hold off saying “love” for now, even though I feel very strongly about her.
Since I gave her that card, she most probably is aware I like her in a special kind of way.
I’m just wondering sometimes though what she’s thinking. Is it something along the lines of “This guy really seems to have strong feelings for me” or “I like him, but I’m not sure yet”? I really wonder.
I actually kinda doubt she feels as strongly, considering I’ve written two fucking poems for her which I haven’t even shown yet (and am too afraid to show honestly), but if she has an interest in me too, I would be happy about that. I’ve become such a prominent part of her life (I think?), so surely it has to mean something. Hopefully positive.</p>

I don’t have the highest self esteem right now, but I do hope to soon go into a state of relaxation. As of now, I’m overthinking things too much. Hell, I can even go crazy sometimes if a conversation with her doesn’t end with “good night”. Fucked up, isn’t it?
Hopefully this is just teen angst BS, because I for once just want to feel at ease, you know? I’m tired of worrying.</p>

<p>Yes, that is a bit neurotic to do, especially at this stage. Or rather, it’s natural for someone (you) to feel that way when they want someone else to reciprocate their feelings, but she isn’t obligated to tell you good night all the time (and some people simply don’t do that) so it’s somewhat neurotic for you to analyze why she did or didn’t and let it affect you negatively every time she doesn’t. Kinda like people who get mad if their significant other doesn’t text them back immediately. Those kind of thoughts are poison and unnecessary</p>
<p>Part of it is definitely due to teen angst, hormones, and the continuing maturation of your brain. In hindsight when you are in your mid 20s and beyond, you’ll start to see that more. But the more conscious you are of these things NOW, the better in control you can be.</p>
<p>Relationships need room to grow and breathe the same way plants need room to grow and spread their roots.</p>

<p>I think the best advice I would give my younger self, and all the high schoolers here is: don’t get hung up and please, for the love of god, don’t ever take love lessons from movies or television. (or most pop culture actually)</p>
<p>one of the biggest mistake of my entire life was tricking myself into not letting go of my high school crush even when she rejected me the second time (she was coaxed by her friends to give me “one more chance” but even though I was completely smitten with her, she just couldn’t reciprocate those feelings), and this was in the middle of junior year of high school. I watched a lot of TV, and since much of television is built on the “will-they, won’t-they” staple, I sincerely believed that persistence would pay off. after all: it works on TV, surely the writers are drawing from real life! (yeah. I know. )</p>
<p>one of the things I found out later was that one of the myriad of reasons she didn’t want to date me was that she felt uncomfortable because (get this) her beautiful best friend had a crush on me that not very many people got, and one that manifested I guess from a bar mitzvah we both attended a year prior to high school. we weren’t friends that much or anything but we talked and had a friend in common for a short amount of time. he was slightly autistic but we bonded in middle school over similar interests and I felt guilty to let that go as his tendencies made him into lesser and lesser of a nice guy. well I guess she thought that was sweet of me, thought I was kinda cute and nursed a crush. that still blows my mind nowadays, and looking back the fucking signals were there.</p>
<p>and how may you ask do I know this? my mom was working under her stepdad, and told me years later. she even at the time asked me not to ask her out, which seemed really random at the time, and I was very oblivious. because, y’know, I was still convinced I could somehow win the heart of my high school crush.</p>
<p>of course I can or can not say whether or not we would’ve worked out if things went in a different direction. I personally feel like it would’ve at least benefited me by giving me an opportunity to explore a relationship in the very basic level, boosting my confidence and what not. it would be much easier for me to let go on something that happened and sparked out rather than “what could’ve been”… I would understand and cope with what happened, and that would wisen me up later on the road. not to mention the fact that I can recall in retrospect being hit on several times as a senior and it completely either going over my head, or I shirked out because of my dopey, impossible crush.</p>
<p>your teenage years are when sexual understanding and possible relationships are the easiest (and some of the most important) to attain because for the most part the opposite sex, no matter the gender, is just as equally curious and impatient to explore their newfound feelings as much as you are, and these are the ways to grow as a person so you can build confidence and a greater understanding of… well everything. to flush that down the toilet on a foolhardy thought that things should go your way due to an absurd view of the way relationships work, and your own hesitation and bizarre entitlement is a real shame. my current situation is strange… I have an insular life almost by design right now, in an attempt to one day build towards hopefully having something more fulfilling, so I’m hoping I eventually run into someone special who understands my plight. but I’m not desperate to find her right now, for the first time in a long time. and it actually genuinely feels freeing, but I still have my regrets. I don’t want some of y’all to have the same.</p>
<p>that’s all I have to say. you can now laugh at my teenage idiocy now, thank you</p>

<p>Gonna bite the bullet. Gonna tell my crush they’re my crush, and that if they are to take one thing away from having known me this short time, it should be that somebody wholesome found them to be patient, kind, logical, intelligent and utterly beautiful inside and out. I’m a complete introvert. I don’t need to see much of this person, to settle down, or to rush things. I just like to have someone to spoil, someone to enjoy silent companionship with, someone I’m not afraid to be vulnerable around and can feel proud of. In spite of everything, this person is my muse.</p>

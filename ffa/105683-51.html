<p>There’s been at least three threads where Mr Black has answered a question with some variation of “No because I’m not a WOMAN” like a) that thing is femme and b) being femme is a terrible thing. So even if he has never posted anything else overtly homophobic, I have no problem believing it, as much of homophobia is rooted in the perception that gay and bi men are feminine and therefor weak and inferior.</p>

<p>Well for one, Panther wasn’t engaging you in a discussion on his sexual orientation. Second, you said you thought it was a typo, so it sounds like you meant to poke fun at that. Maybe just don’t be a jackass?</p>

<p>I’d say that’s an image that supports board members being reasonable upset. I mean, the scene is from The Cartridge Family, Homer used all their dinner plates for target practice.</p>

<p>Not defending anyone in particular but the quoting really doesn’t bother me. Quite often a thread moves on fast, so you’d allow for that when preparing your response. It’s also faster than tagging with a lot of usernames.</p>

<p>Also, if the thread is movin fast and you feel the need to quote something(even tho a million people have already quoted it) your post more than likely will not appear right under what you’re quoting</p>

<p>Thread can begin moving fast at any time; it’s not predictable. I’d feel compelled to go back and apologise for crossposting if my scathing response hit the wrong poster.</p>

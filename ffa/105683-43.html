<p>Always ask for her number. You gotta take action yourself, not passively sit around waiting for something to happen from her side. So next time, ask both those questions.</p>

<p>A girl is trying to help me become more confident and make myself more appealing to girls. She keeps telling me to smile when I’m talking to people, but it hurts to do that all the time. She made me put my arm around her yesterday, and it was really uncomfortable. She said my body was extremely tense and that I was barely touching her. She’s also putting me on a workout regimen because I’m not comfortable with my body; yesterday she texted me and told me to do 50 crunches.</p>

<p>Feels weird to ask for both things, but if I have no choice, I guess I have to do it. Thanks, Matty.</p>

<p>why would he be going on tinder and talking to girls if he liked me? he’s my best friend as well, the best friend i’ve ever had, and if i’ve fucked up our friendship i don’t know what i’ll do.</p>

<p>I think you two need to talk. Stewing over something like this isn’t going to help things between you.</p>

<p>i’m so scared to talk to him about this but i guess i’ll have to at some point…</p>
<p>he honestly means so much to me and i don’t care if he’s not attracted to me, because we’ll still be friends - but we’ve only known each other for four months, so what’s stopping him from getting a girlfriend and forgetting about me? i know that might seem really selfish and greedy, but we’ve invested so much time in each other lately that there’s bound to be some attraction between both of us. so if there’s a sign that he’s not happy with our friendship in some way anymore i’m gonna feel down as well.</p>
<p>he’s been the most important person to me ever and our friendship has been getting really great. if our friendship falls apart because of something stupid i know that’s gonna hurt me a lot. hopefully i’ll eventually summon the courage to talk to him and maybe sort this out.</p>

<p>Friend I was messaging on fb just text me asking if he can be completely honest about something and immediately sent “Nope no worries forget I said anything”.</p>
<p>He blatantly wants to be with me. I really like him but not that way and also I live counties away but I just don’t want a relationship and if there’s one thing that makes me back away slowly it’s someone actually being interested. Well, it’s that or he’s coming out as a paedophile. Either is equally plausible given that he seems never to date anyone over 18 and he’s like 33.</p>

<p>^ Correcto. This person is 33, long term unemployed, looks and acts a lot younger than his age, and suffers from serious mental health problems. He was my drinking buddy and I like him, but he serially dates teenagers on the internet and that alone bothers me. The friends he sees most are a lot younger too, and they inevitably leave him in the dust when they’re old enough to go somewhere cool. He clearly does it because no adult would be impressed with where he is in life. I say this with sympathy because I’m on a similar road but happen to be ace so have not explored my feelings about age / power play. I was, genuinely, seriously, in two minds about whether it’d be he liked me or he was into children, when he claimed to have a confession to make. And no, I don’t want to be his beard.</p>
<p>Also, Johnny, I feel your pain wrt relatively new but important person, and I hope you guys stick it out.</p>

<p>She’s also putting me on a workout regimen because I’m not comfortable with my body; yesterday she texted me and told me to do 50 crunches.</p>
</div>
<p>If you can’t comfortably do 50 crunches then it might be counterproductive to give you that advice, as you might hurt yourself physically and that might make you stop, or you may try, not be able to do that exact number, and get discouraged and give up. I’d recommend doing whatever number you can comfortably, safely do now, and stick to that and then slowly increase it by whatever increment you want.</p>
<p>If you can do 50 crunches though, disregard the above, do it and keep going onwards.</p>

<p>Yeah, she told me to do 50 crunches three times today, and I’m simply not ready to 150 of them a day. I finally told her to stop doing that; I’m aware that I need to exercise, and I will take her advice to do it more often; however, I was told that she would help me with my social issues, like practicing smiling and talking to people, which she has, but I didn’t sign up for a physical trainer and don’t want her to keep hounding me about it.</p>

<p>Hamm, I know nothing about Tinder but I’d arrange a sorta date thing, something caz. Rating her on an app would not be the end of the world if you’re friends of compatible orientation. It’s a compliment. Like, don’t be on Tinder if you can’t handle a person being vaguely interested? It’s hardly sexual assault.</p>

<p>Can’t tell if I’ve fucked up a good thing. Should I be cool with the girl I’m into sleeping with and liking someone else too? Maybe I’m just being too sensitive. I like her so much though and it hurts a bit that I’m not the only guy she’s close to. Is that narcissistic? Can’t tell if its a natural reaction or if I’m being possessive.</p>
<p>I told her we shouldn’t hang out any more because I wasn’t comfortable with her and the other guy. Was kinda hoping that would prompt her to stop things with the other guy and choose me. She just got upset and now I feel like I’ve let her down.  I’m a manipulative bastard and I’ve pushed her away completely. I should have just enjoyed the time we spent together and not worried about him.</p>

<p>&#64;Scully Apologist Yeah, don’t do that. Cutting off your nose to spite your face, man. You want her to think you’re above giving ultimatums. Right now she probably thinks you don’t even like her for her and only want one thing. (Then again, if that was true, you’d have done the right thing distancing yourself.) Your “possessive” feelings are natural, but it will make people uncomfortable if you bring it up. Gotta work through it on your own. Can’t remember where I read it, but a jealous partner has no ideal match - they have problems both dating people who are not possessive and dating people who are possessive, because two wrongs don’t make a right. I’m still working on this, but we have to find ways to make the strength of our feelings for that person known without overwhelming them so that they feel we’re hard work. IYSWIM, jealousy is valid but if you experience it with a casual partner you’re likely to also experience it in marriage where it may be unwarranted.</p>
<p>Idk I think it’s more complicated for people who overthink things, regardless of orientation. There are additional stresses in going after someone of the same sex, but I don’t think there’s particularly a correlation between that and the anxiety exhibited in threads like these. Also the board demographic is very male and very introverted/awkward, so we can’t draw conclusions about how sexuality affects confidence etc.</p>

<p>Oh dear God, Scully Apologist!</p>
<p>Look, you should apologize you got jealous over her and the other guy if you want to keep seeing her. Because if you keep doing this, that you constantly break off contact, then re-contact her, she might be put off so much eventually she won’t feel like seeing you ever again.
She clearly wants you by her side, so why is it so hard to just support her? You can talk about your jealousy with her if you have to, but as it is right now, you are only psychologically damaging yourself by doing like this.</p>
<p>I mean, I can strongly relate to jealous feelings. I’m just worried about you, is all.</p>

<p>It’s not that I’m a massively jealous person. It’s just I was reluctant to get involved with her to begin with because I knew they had a bit of history. But she reassured me that they were just friends now and so we started hooking up. It’s more a feeling that I’ve been misled. I’m fairly good friends with the guy too so it’s not a nice situation to be in. Also it’s someone she works with so she inevitably sees him more often than me. Ah well</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice guys. Going to apologise for all my bullshit today and make a serious effort not to be so neurotic.</p>

<p>she called me an amazing friend for helping though, which made me feel good but also means there’s probably no chance for a relationship beyond friendship to develop</p>

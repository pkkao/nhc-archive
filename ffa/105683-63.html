<p>Thanks, but… What the hell can I learn from this? Nothing. I tried my damned hardest, I was the most well-tempered happy person I’ve ever been with her. I never once got angry before this whole debacle.</p>

<p>well, maybe she just felt that you two weren’t meant for each other. i have no idea who this woman is or what she thought of you, but maybe you just weren’t meant to be. and, if you were a well-tempered person, then you should eventually find someone who loves you for who you are.</p>
<p>i know this sounds really cheesy, but i hope it is comforting for you.</p>

<p>just because you’re not in a relationship doesn’t mean you can’t learn from it? maybe try to hold it together easier next time, because from the way you acted and the thing she wrote it’s pretty easy to tell you just can’t keep your composure. also this should be a lesson to make sure you tell them you like them sooner rather than later, so you’re not wasting your time with someone who doesn’t want to be with you</p>

<p>You learn people can easily pull your emotions. Overtime, your emotions will grow a tougher shell that takes true love to break down. It took me a long time to realize it.</p>

<p>Update from me: more gratuitous displays of affection in spite of knowing we’re not likely to be a thing. I guess I just want ‘em to be happy. Or like, not unhappy. And it takes a village, not one magical right person to do that.</p>

<p>Damn, that must suck. To find a person you love more than anything, and find she doesn’t feel the same? Heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Hope you get through this okay, and that you could someday have good luck.</p>
<p>As for what you could use for the future, you could use this as a learning experience. Sometimes, people just aren’t made for each other. You should see if the person you have a crush on shows affection towards you. If you do, they could be the one!</p>
<p>Of course, what do I know? I’ve never had a crush on anyone.</p>

<p>i have actually never experienced heartbreak, due to the fact that i don’t have any friends irl.</p>
<p>this is also why i have never been in a relationship of any kind.</p>

<p>i don’t mean to sound cruel hearted though because i’ve been in an unfortunate situation with a crush myself for almost a year, just it’s not a unique situation to be in and we all have to face it one day</p>

<p>you didn’t really sound cruel-hearted to me. even though i’ve never experienced that kind of love, and have never experienced heartbreak by extension, i can understand where people who go through this come from, because i have heard enough about heartbreak to know what affects that can have on a person.</p>
<p>honestly, i’ll probably eventually experience the same heartbreak all of you guys have, but i don’t have any non-internet friends, and don’t go out much except for school, and nobody likes me there, so i never have to worry about heartbreak because i will never fall in love in the first place.</p>
<p>i know this post has kind of turned into me talking about myself, and i’m pretty sure it sounds like i’m begging for sympathy, but i just felt the need to share this somewhere.</p>

<p>Some people throw the word “love” around too easily and that leads to more complications in the first place than anything.</p>

<p>I mean, talking about yourself isn’t really ‘begging for sympathy’</p>

<p>Thanks, but… What the hell can I learn from this?</p>
</div>
<p>How much time did you waste on this crush before telling her you liked her (/being so obvious that you liked her that she figured it out herself)? If the answer is a lot (months? a year? idk) then you learned something super important. If you told her you liked her at the start then not only would you not waste this time, but you would prevent yourself from internally building more of this “love”, and then it wouldn’t suck nearly as much when she said she didn’t like you like that. Go try to go on dates with 10 different girls without already building huge crushes and just see how it goes.</p>
<p>I think you have something worse to worry about, and it will crash down on you in 10 years or so. Don’t waste your youth. Realize you can improve your life, and go out and do it. That doesn’t mean you have to pathetically go and try to chase love, it just means, you need to get something going. You need to realize that socializing is important, from networking for future career to just, having a life. So go join a sport or a club or idk, something…</p>

<p>In other news, I actually have two partners now. My boyf and I have been in a polyamorous relationship but I haven’t had another partner myself, but basically my boyf’s other partner and I developed feelings for each other, it was complicated but we decided it was worth trying it out.  Feeling pretty sweet right now.</p>

<p>Last day in this town. Off to meet the ‘crush’ I’ve talked too much about in this here thread. Don’t think I’m really into her anymore but alcohol and fever might  well change that.</p>

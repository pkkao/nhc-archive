<p>Once she accepts your facebook friend request, you should do a cover of this song for her</p>

<p>you asked her to add her on facebook?!</p>

<p>As a person who never had a Facebook, I’m not sure what’s so bad about this. Does it make it too obvious that he likes her?</p>

<p>very, considering facebook requests are usually considered the mildest form of “acquaintance” possible in this age outside of maybe “work friends”</p>

<p>It’s just kind of redundant to ask someone if you can add them on facebook since when you send a request it asks them to agree or decline the request.</p>

<p>Yes, I’ve talked with her a little through there. She’s up in a whole lot now though since she has 3 big tests next week, holy shit.
But she seems to be fine and is acting very nice</p>

<p>Hey, I have a question: The girl I like hasn’t been to class for two classes in a row. I’m wondering if I should send her a friendly email. Something like, “Hi Martha! How are you doing? I hope you’re feeling all right. You’re my only friend here, and I miss you! Hope to see you soon!”</p>
<p>Do you think she’d consider that nice, or just weird?</p>

<p>well if you’re her friend i don’t think she’d find it weird</p>

<p>Sure, especially if you are that friendly with each other. Most girls would appreciate that. How many days has it been?</p>
<p>I would edit that ‘only friend’ part, though. Sounds a bit too lonely. Maybe just bring it down to ‘Miss you &amp; hope to see you soon!’ if you want it to become more than just friends</p>

<p>It’s only been two days. Maybe I should wait to see if she’s gone on Monday too. And thanks for the advice. I’ll change it if I end up sending it.</p>

<p>Two days may be a bit short, but on the other hand you can end your message by wishing her a nice weekend. I’d say you could go for it</p>

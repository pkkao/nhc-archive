<p>Tinder is an app essentially used for hooking up.</p>
<p>Adult Friend Finder is also used for such but operates like a dating website. I signed up briefly while in a funk after being cheated on, almost met up with a guy (date/time/location all planned), didn’t go through with it, and deleted my account.</p>

<p>Tinder works well, it’s hard to not hook up there.  Things like Adult Friend Finder are good for older woman, lots of ladies in their 30’s and up.  It’s not a bad thing, hooked up with a 41 year old through there not too long ago.</p>

<p>I used a lot of hookup apps when I turned 18, the gay ones at least. I’ve made some friends from em. They will work, just be wary of some people.</p>

<p>Now I’ve been to the movie with her.
I experienced a whole lot of feelings. They were a mixture of happiness, nervosity, sudden sadness and feeling of ambiguity. It was wonderful to finally do something with her and I was overjoyed to see The Theory Of Everything with her. At the same time, I still have insecurities about myself and even though everything seems to look up, I at the same time feel like I have no idea what’s going to happen.
Nevertheless, this was something I really needed. I’m so glad this happened.</p>

<p>So, looking back, it seems that you didn’t go through with your original plan</p>
<p>Pity. Would’ve really spiced this thread up.</p>

<p>So you had to stoop so low that you reference what I call, the Virginity-Rape-Controversy.
Oh well.</p>

<p>Apparently, do everything wrong.
Receive a forty five minute tirade about just how much I suck and everyone hates me.
Cry.
Get told I’m melodramatic for crying when being picked on while ill.
Try to have a normal conversation a few days later.
Offer to help with a charity thing.
Get told no and that I never mentioned it before.
Tell them I totally did, and it’s not my problem if they don’t remember.
Tell them exactly what I think, because I want them exorcised from my life and they need to hate me for that to work.
They hate me.
For being honest.
Honest like they were.
Well, fuck.</p>

<p>I appreciate the comment.   I’m quite happysad. Just wish none of this had happened and we could’ve grown apart naturally. Instead, now another person I honestly cannot be arsed with. It’s not even like I don’t love him, but he was rude, would hear no mention of his double standards, and insisted that he was super nice about everything and I’m just a shit. Honestly suspect that he thinks we’re playing the long game - but we aren’t. If you want to make me emotionally dependent on you just so you can then deny me comfort, fuck you. Especially if you’re an openly manipulative twunt who refuses to believe that there is a single person alive who does not have “abusive tendencies”. (And I’m not saying I don’t, but there certainly ARE people who don’t, you cynical ass.) Well, if that’s what you’re like when you hold back, I had a lucky escape…</p>
<p>Feeling sassy though. Prozac has made my life not suck so considerably, and I don’t feel like I need alcohol, sex or religion in any way.</p>

<p>I wish you good luck with your life,   &#64;#Halloween (wish I wouldn’t have to use a hashtag, but hey it’s your username ). By the way, if he is under the delusion he’s super nice and all but still treats you like a sack of garbage, how the hell can he still think he’s nice? If he discover you are emotionally hurt, he should stop and think “Oh, maybe I’m actually being an asshole, I should apologize before it’s too late”. But he didn’t and he only has himself to blame. He will most probably regret what he did eventually (not everyone does, but let’s say it’s the case) and then he will slam his head against a table for not being there for you when he should have.
Reminds me by the way of the very awkward and horrible way a girl broke up with me. She yelled plenty of stuff, including that I was “obsessed” over her and shit. I asked her several months later if she really hated me and she said it was just the fever sickness putting her in a bad mood. Well, okay, but that doesn’t excuse for the psychological damage it gave me. My self-esteem became lower and ever and I felt like I wasn’t worthy enough for love at all. I just thought of myself as a plague, someone who is just not meant to bond with anyone in that way. Sure I would’ve been sad with her breaking up with me anyway, but the cruel way she did it made it a LOT worse. Lot.
So, my point is, I’m glad you weren’t as struck by separating from someone as I was. Not everyone is able to deal with that, but I think you have the strength. So for now, enjoy life while you really can.</p>

<p>I said some things myself in the second conversation which were not kind. I wish to apologise. It’s taken me this long, not to find an excuse for it, but because I want to be sure that the way I am apologising isn’t just a further example of assholery which will make me look like I feel entitled to forgiveness. Everything I said to him was accurate, and none of it particularly cruel, but he left with the impression that I had always felt that way, when in reality I thought he could do no wrong until I started taking Prozac. So basically, I need to learn coping mechanisms for others’ negativity. I’m not used to noticing it at all, and I’m aware that it makes me seem a hypocrite after how depressed and needy I have been, but unfortunately part of my treatment has involved becoming an optimist and becoming more objective, which means I see things I never would have minded before and have to learn not to call things as I see them.</p>
<p>And yes, this is more than he would ever offer me after the things he said. I don’t mind. We’re in very different places, psychologically, and it can’t be helped.</p>

<p>How do you know that? I was completely unsure if I would go anywhere with the girl I have a crush on, but now everything is feeling wonderful. All it takes is talking to the person you are interested in, and in time, who knows… you could bond with each other in the best imaginable way. If you are shy, that’s fine of course. But I don’t see any reason giving up.</p>

<p>One of the whole points of a crush is that you know it won’t get anywhere but you’re just so infatuated with them that you kind of have no sense of what you can or cannot do with them.</p>

<p>Well since this thread keeps going to depressing places over and over again, will lighten it up a bit with my own gooey mush.</p>
<p>I have all sorts of feelings for this guy who is just…. <em>dreamy sigh</em>. I am completely smitten, you guys. He is wonderful. He is a wonderful friend, probably the sweetest person I have ever met, wonderful to talk to, smart, funny, charming, gorgeous, we have lots in common… I’ve just never met anyone as wonderful as he is. I am all giddy and giggly and so fucking delighted that I even know him. Can’t recall ever feeling quite like this. And he seems to feel the same bout me. I’m just…</p>

<p>I kind of both miss and don’t miss the feeling of infatuation at the same time. it’s always a mix of giddy excitement and paranoia-fueled dread</p>
<p>right now I’m just working dead hours, work with mostly old/married women and online dating is just pointless for me right now, not to mention the overhang of absolute self-depreciation. it’s ultimately good for my overall psyche, but I’ll admit a small part of me does long for at the very least the pure ebullient feeling that overwhelms you around a crush. body is really craving those manfactured chemical brain reactions, man</p>

<p>I just feel put out that I only got the one dream where he kissed me. My imagination must be poor. I wonder if that’s a factor in people’s sexual frustration, and, while nothing would make it a good excuse, a factor in people pushing others too far? Obviously we are all in control of our own behaviour, and fantasising can in itself lead you to a warped view of someone in real life (just as porn can lead to a warped view of sexual characteristics and their associated humans), but I do wish I was able. Still haven’t apologised, and it’s been a week. Probably because I’m not even sure what I’m apologising for, and whenever I bring it up my friends tell me I’ve done nothing wrong. I do feel that I’ve done something wrong, if only because my words touched a nerve (though he denied it), and because I was not my usual adoring self and didn’t back down and it did go on for two hours. I’m sorry my two cents was unhelpful? I need a specific thing to apologise for and make amends, but I can’t really think of one. Nothing I said was particularly unkind - more a “Have you considered?” / “Some people might view that differently” kind of tone. Argh. I shouldn’t back down though, should I? If I apologise when I feel like I shouldn’t, I’m just consenting to be controlled, and in the worst kind of way because the person would never admit to caring about anything that concerns me. So how do I stay friends with this person?</p>
<p>So happy for you,   &#64;Smiling Politely!</p>

Thank you.  I feel really happy for me too. I feel lucky to even know this person, let alone to have them in my life in such a meaningful way.</p>
<p>And as for your own troubles, it doesn’t sound to me as if you have done anything wrong and you most definitely should not be apologising. It sounds more like HE needs to be doing the apologising. It sounds like he’s acting in a really confusing way that is just fat out not fair to you and you deserve to be treated better than that. I understand completely how confusing and shitty this kind of thing can feel, and I hope that all of this starts to get better. If he can’t handle you being honest rather than “your usual adoring self” than it’s more his problem than yours. I wouldn’t want to advise you since I don’t know the full story and wouldn’t want to lead you in the wrong direction or anything, but just keep doing what you feel is right and don’t let anyone walk all over you. If you ever need someone to lend an ear to get this kind of thing off your chest, you can feel free to message me.</p>

<p>Now it’s done.
She had been found drunk seven times by her mom, so she was grounded. Thefore, had to get home earlier.
But still, I had a wonderful time! Didn’t get any time to watch a movie, but we watched a lot of random YouTube videos and just talked about plenty of different stuff. She is very frisky and asked sometimes if she had said something weird. Which she did, but that’s part of the charm
When she was freezing outside, I offered her my jacket. We hugged before she left and when she got on the tram… I already missed her. I hope it won’t be too long before we see each other again.
I think it’s perfectly possible I have a crush on someone else now.</p>

<p>Considering that he’s already attempted asking her out, that might be a bit awkward, no?</p>

<p>Yeah. If you’re not super-excited about being friends for friends’ sake, I agree it’d be awkward to go on that specific “date” after originally proposing it as a date. I’m not accusing you of not wanting to be friends with her at all, but I’m getting the vibe that the level of intimacy you wanted isn’t on offer as a friend, and you wouldn’t be wrong to move on to someone else.</p>

<p>so a couple of weeks back i was out drinking and i bump into one of my flatmates. to my surprise as soon as he sees me he kisses me on the cheek, which seemed pretty weird as he had pretty much never shown any kind of affection for me in the past. i was pretty shocked at this but i kind of shrugged it off initially. i bump into him several more times that night and he keeps hugging me and stuff, but this one time he kisses me on my hand, and then when i’m about to leave he kind of grabs my crotch (um what) and proceeds to ask me if i “have a boner” when we meet again in our flat.</p>
<p>ok yeah we were both kind of drunk so he might not have actually meant to do all that stuff, but it doesn’t sound like the sort of thing you’d do to another guy unless you had some suppressed feeling for them. bear in mind he wasn’t doing it to anyone else that night either. and also he’s told me himself that he’s bisexual (he doesn’t know i’m gay though). he’s also shown several verbal hints that he’s liked me before but i never really took notice of it until now.</p>
<p>so basically my plan was to kind of return the favour the next time i see him (next weekend) and full on kiss him, and if he is genuinely interested in me move on from there.  like what harm can it do right?</p>

<p>Didn’t get my movie date. Guess we’re just too far apart, and when opportunity knocks to do something, which is rarely, it’s not possible for both of us. :/ Still on good terms, though. They deserved a treat. I’m just pissed because I don’t have any friends who’d go to this with me.</p>

<p>This isn’t necessarily a crush, per say, but I got an opportunity to take a date to my fraternity’s formal. A buddy of mine was looking for a designated driver, so he asked me and mentioned that he has a friend looking for a date. I’ve met her a few times in the past, and she seems pretty cool, but I haven’t talked to her in probably a year and I’m not sure how I feel trying to get acquainted with a near stranger at formal no less. On the other hand, I haven’t had luck come my way in terms of relationships anytime recently (except the girl who took me to Deadpool) so I’m kinda torn.</p>
<p>what do you guys recommend?</p>

<p>OSS, you’re an unintentionally funny sort of person. When you actually make an attempt at a joke though, holy fuck does it fall flat.</p>

<p>have you guys ever been attracted to a person that repulses you at the same time? that’s what it’s like with one of my coworkers who I haven’t seen in a long while but now arrives at the end of my shift due to the schedule change.</p>
<p>she’s kind of annoying, a heavy smoker (if you sit next to her she reeks of smoke), a dirty gossiper and a little skeevy. also she’s kinda hot and a bit of a flirt. when she arrives and sits next to me there’s just this voice in my head that keeps saying, “don’t give in” and I try to just act casual and nice. she’s always wearing tight clothes and jeans and then my brain goes to where it goes and there’s this bizarre simultaneous feeling of desire and immediate regret and shame. granted, I do think she legitimately finds me cute from when we used to work together (which I can’t even comprehend) and that’s gotta have something to do with it subconsciously. I’m also thinking that it’s just my animal brain searching for any possible path towards sexual satisification and the emotional struggle that comes with it. needless to say that I work with almost no single women my age and I don’t get out much otherwise. especially not socially. I just really want to just stop thinking this way because it just feels wrong.</p>
<p>so there you have it: a post in here asking how to avoid getting laid. inconcievable, I know.</p>

<p>I would give you advice, but as someone who has given into his baser urges with women of a similar nature on several occasions… I really can’t say I’ve ever experienced much of a downside to my actions. Then again, I’ve also never had to deal with the fallout of fucking a co-worker because I’ve never fucked a co-worker. Classmates, yes, but petty bullshit in your teen years is a different beast to work related drama in your 20s.</p>
<p>If you really need to deter yourself that much, just keep the co-worker thing in mind as much as you can and picture how ugly things could get for you if you guys screw and things don’t pan out well in the long run.</p>

<p>lust is a bitch. i used to have a crush on my geology lab partner, but she’s honestly smoked herself stupid. even though she’s hot, and pretty chill, she’s a disaster to work with as she just stares blankly and expects me to do all the work.</p>

<p>Lust is definitely a bitch but just think of all that lovely miserable grossness and regret you’ll be steeped in if you end up doing anything with someone that apparently repulses you!!</p>

<p>it really is. if i tried to make any kind of move, i know her boyfriend and his frat would kill me even though I’m cool with him.</p>
<p>and that’s just something in general. lust won’t get you somewhere, only the right love will.</p>

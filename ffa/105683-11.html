<p>I wasn’t going to show you at first, but… since Financial Panther did, here’s what she looks like:
It’s the only picture of her available. It’s two years old and blurry, but she still looks beautiful</p>

<p>Engage them in a three hour long conversation about everything under the sun. Admit to being fur-curious just for some common ground. Smile myself to sleep. Smile myself awake. Smile. Smile. Smile.</p>

<p>Having your first crush on someone the same sex as you is really great and shit at the same time. Really great because you have your first crush but shit because they’re probably straight and you have to keep it a secret from them and you get all disappointed because you were hoping they weren’t straight. And then after that they’re just a normal friend and it’s meh.</p>

<p>Panther posting the picture of her was un-cool, oldschoolersimpson posting pictures of her is un-cool, I get that it could be facebook and it may not be illegal, but what do you seriously think she would say if you asked her about it?</p>

<p>BOUN.DA.RIES. I’d feel angry, violated, and creeped out if someone did that to me. Showing your IRL friends a picture she publicly posted is one thing, posting her pic to a message board full of strangers is quite another.</p>

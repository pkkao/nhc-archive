<p>Let’s not be encouraging people to “just kiss” someone. My female friend gave me that as advice and she had no idea how pissy I would’ve been if I was dumb enough to do as she said and it backfired. I’m autistic, so when I was younger I would’ve just done that because she said it was okay. You don’t have to be autistic to follow the lead of people you look up to enough to ask for advice, and seeing people on forums make these suggestions really gets my back up because I’ve been sexually assaulted a fair few times, as have most biological females, as have men I have been with, and if that kind of sitch is avoidable I’d prefer it is avoided. /twocents</p>

<p>I met this lady back in February or so, and I didn’t even have to do much. She heard me playing piano/guitar and she just came over and told me her whole life story. So once we’ve talked enough and moved into more comfortable territory, past all the getting to know each other and figuring each other out shit, she moves to Gary, Indiana (I’m in Chicago). This happened without warning. And I’m going through a stage in my life where all I wanna do is hump and move on…and then this happens.</p>
<p>So I’m taking a couple of buses and a train to go get that tang. I don’t wanna hang out in bars and act insincere and meet chicks who have “GUYS LIKE TO FUK ME” faces. I actually got to know this woman, which will make the coitus oh so much sweeter.</p>

<p>Talk to them about normal things quite frequently and feel uncomfortably attached.</p>
<p>Curse that I somehow fancy them MORE since opening up about it.</p>
<p>Just want to be a normal friendly friend.</p>
<p>Keep offering to do helpful things.</p>

<p>Got drunk last night and drunk texted the potential squeeze. I said some pretty bold things, yadda yadda yadda, now we’re both on the same page. I’m gonna dig this chick out real nice.</p>
<p>So…yeah. I guess that’s the end of my little story…I mean, it’s obvious how it’s going to end. None of you cared anyway.</p>

<p>While I never knew you, I always think it’s cool when a user who hasn’t been here since ages ago returns in a thread you’d never expect him/her to.

<p>Every so often, I’m up for a nice after school special. It’s been over 10 years since Dawson’s Creek.</p>
<p>Also, reading through this thread was like watching House. So tell me, is this obsession going to culminate into you smashing your car through her house?</p>

<p>The thing about dates though, is that you ask for them…
At this rate, you’ll be going on a year of awkwardly chasing after this girl. It’s May. This thread opened up in September of last year. Getting that date is really up to you, not her. I mean, it has to be. You’re the one who likes her. It’s unclear how she feels, but you know how you feel, so it’s your responsibility to connect what you want to experience with your reality.</p>
<p>Whatever you’re good at, use it to your advantage. Make courtship your own experience. I told the girl who I’m gonna be seeing soon that “The recombination of your paternal and maternal dominant and recessive genes are visually and aesthetically pleasing,” and guess what? It worked. It was entirely silly, and it worked. I made an ass of myself on purpose, and it worked out because I am a silly ass. And she thought it was charming. At this point, I don’t care how I did it. It doesn’t matter. And you know what else I found out through that? She has liked me ever since we met. I am a bit clueless sometimes, but see how a person gets the courage to move outside of their comfort zones when someone else does it first?</p>
<p>I just want you to get the girl, man.</p>

<p>No progress at all whatsoever. In fact, I even feel like it’s going backwards.
You,    &#64;Financial Panther?</p>
</div>
<p>Well, I was in a class with a girl who really seemed to take a shine to me. That class ended earlier than my other classes, but she invited me for some ice cream, and we’re going to get some on Thursday. I told my mom, and she started screaming, “WHAT? WHAT? That sounds like a date to me!” That never crossed my mind, but if it is…cool.</p>

<p>I actually used to do that all the time w my crush in middle school. When TCBY still existed, we’d share a banana split every Friday. The benefit of having your best friend as crush is all that unintended intimacy that was gonna happen anyway.</p>

<p>ugh am actually hating high school romance</p>
<p>do I like her or the idea of her being my girlfriend
will my interpretation of her change when I’m not viewing her from a distance and I’m actually viewing her up close
will my interpretation of her change when I’m not observing her personality from snippets of day to day conversation and when I get to experience her emotions and second hand emotions and every thing else</p>
<p>leave all “biasesumo3 is such a teenage drama queen” comments down below, but I just needed somewhere to type this</p>

<p>What’s there to be scared though? That you might reply something that turns her off? Just write hi back.</p>

<p>That’s the beauty of Facebook. You can reply anytime you like.</p>
<p>If she asks what took so long, you can make up an excuse. When you’re talking to someone on the internet, who’s gonna know?</p>

<p>I’m not sure when I’m going to start using that Clover app. I’ve set up a profile and everything, but I’m not sure how my parents would react to me having that app. Should probably wait until I go to a university to actually start using it.</p>

<p>-Accidentally bump into your crush every now and then and feel convinced that they know you like them, because you keep accidentally seeing them everywhere.
-If you see your crush but you don’t speak to them, you get worried that they think you don’t like them anymore or that you’re ignoring them. If you do speak to them, you’re worried they know you like them.</p>

<p>I don’t want to deny it</p>
<p>if she was skinny, she would not have to rely on fat humour which she does all the fucking time
her weight would also not matter if that wasn’t all she relys on</p>

<p>really watch a melissa mccarthy movie and you’ll realize that unlike kevin james, her shtick is more like “I’M OBNOXIOUS AND AM A LOUDMOUTH”</p>
<p>and still, even with the some of the fat jokes, there’s really no reason to insult her being “fat”</p>
<p>this is an oss-level move, mate. don’t be like oss</p>

<p>You’re politely asking a guy you just trashed by comparing him to the lowest common denominator how he’s doing?</p>
<p>It doesn’t faze you because you’re a teenager? Is that sarcasm?</p>

<p>we teens are the “shrug it off you sick lad” generation so my post means that because she doesn’t like me I’m supposed to ignore the general fact she doesn’t like me</p>
<p>else we become subject to jeering and loss of self esteem.</p>
<p>still like her though, her eyes crinkle in a lovely way when you make her laugh really hard and her eyes in general are pre good</p>

main reason why I haven’t asked her out and missed my window I think
fear of rejection</p>

<p>Maybe she just sees you as a very close friend.
It’s probably not very healthy for you to go and hope for her to break up with him or to be together with you at the same time. Just… Just focus on something/someone else!</p>

<p>Don’t know why you don’t just add her on a social network. This does not have to be so complicated when nothing has even happened yet. You know her name. She is a classmate. That is literally all you need to befriend anyone on FB.  And you don’t even NEED the classmate stipulation.</p>

<p>It went fine. I asked her (just to be safe) if I could add her on Facebook and she said “Yes, but I’m not logged in so often”.
Oh, and it was wonderful seeing her as usual.</p>

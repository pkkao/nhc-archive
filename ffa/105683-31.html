<p>I’ve never had a serious crush but if I’m with a girl I like, I typically try to act cool while slightly aloof. If I get into a conversation with said girl, I’ll just try to keep a friendly attitude and maybe make a light-hearted joke while trying not to say anything weird.</p>
<p>It works 0% of the time.</p>

<p>Oh come on. I do a poor job at backing up an argument and now I’m against women playing video games all together?</p>
<p>For the record, when I do talk to girls I like, the topic of gaming is usually going to come up since it’s something I find easy to talk about.</p>

<p>Get drunk and not notice my friend texting creepy shit to my crush when she’s supposed to be on ebay on my phone.
Search back in the conversation in the morning and realise the stuff I say usually is actually worse so no wonder my crush was like “dun wori bout it”.</p>
<p>Tell my crush that I can’t really bring myself to get worked up about anything as long as I have a friend in them.
Their reply? “You do. Don’t worry.”</p>

<p>Take ‘em on a date, get severe anxiety and be awful company, redeem myself by showing them my pets and giving ‘em treats I can’t afford because lol fuk me i dnt dzrv n.e.fing, send ‘em something I thought was amusing at 3am seeing as they said they’d be up all night, it descends into a winding convo where they deny a lot of things they definitely said r.e. wanting intimacy, I get no points for saying does it really matter how I construed those comments given that I haven’t and wouldn’t try to touch you. I’m definitely being ignored now, even though they said glad I’m feeling better. Don’t exactly blame them because I’ve been in an awful relapse this week but ugh thank you crush for turning me against people who YES are taking advantage of me, making you the only person I trust, making it so my goodwill is no longer spread between several douchebags, and then denying having said things because you blatantly want me to think I’m delusional. You don’t have to do this! I just want to play animal crossing and talk furry shit and reptiles. I hate talking about me, but I’m unwell so it happens anyway and I always regret it. Yer on a fucking power trip. In some ways I actually don’t like you, but goddamnit I LOVE YOU and I’m glad you’re moving away because it’s going to be perfect being online friends but knowing you’re at least kinda who you say you are. You say people always want “more”, but does it matter if they want more as long as they don’t have ulterior motives that they act on? I don’t want to play games. I’d like to not be afraid to tell you you aren’t perfect yourself when you have no qualms about ripping me to shreds. Tried that once and almost lost you. I think you’re scared that you’ve led me on. NO, no, no, no, no. Saying you never meant to give anyone hope for the future. What future? I’m suicidally depressed! I live for the now. I like waking up and thinking I have even one friend who understands me, in real life. Simple pleasures. I like the acknowledgement of you responding to something I posted or wishing me luck. I’d give you anything, asshole! And ask for nothing tangible in return. Just the pleasure of your company while we do whatever the hell YOU want. It’s not like no one wants to be with me; plenty of people do. But like your good self, I don’t want to be touched. I want someone to talk full on nasty with from the safety of my own computer. I know you do, too. How is it that I can’t show in my actions what I say with so many words? UGH. /rant</p>

<p>I’m not reacting badly to you not wanting more. I’m reacting badly to /me/ not wanting more and <em>still asking</em> and ~driving a wedge between us~ because I can’t accept myself for what I am, which is absolutely content with a list of internet buddies and no human contact (albeit agitated by the abnormality of that).</p>
<p>I love you more than I thought possible, but not in the ways I expected to. The first time you said you were moving away, we were at the pub. I thought, “I’m supposed to be sad,” but I wasn’t sad - more like relieved, and then kind of excited, because I wouldn’t have to do the “in person” thing that I find so draining, but I could keep you in my life because we happen to both be people who enjoy the internet thing.</p>
<p>It’s too perfect, and so I overthink it.</p>

<p>Update.</p>
<p>My crush is moving all the way across the country on Monday and the last time I’ll see them is tomorrow. I am crying just thinking about it; how pathetic. I don’t know what to do. I wanna hug them so bad. I don’t want them to think of me as the melodramatic prick who cries when they tell me hard truths and when they go away. Do I hug them? Do I kiss their hand? This is so hard. They’re never coming back to this city again. I feel like my heart’s been ripped open. There’s nothing left for me here, but I’ve signed up for three years of it and I can’t even really move for a year. Not that I want to follow them. And I do love to be alone. I just can’t always cope. I wish I was different.</p>

<p>Well, maybe she can, but I can also talk to my own crush on Facebook, which goes fuckin’ nowhere. I understand the pain.</p>
<p>What does kes mean with “them” though? Is it more than one person?</p>

<p>We do talk on Facebook. I’ll be saying my goodbyes this evening. We’re going out for dinner. Not a relationship that was going anywhere per se, but we’ve had some nice times and are very frank with each other. I don’t know when I’ll see them again, but we’ll keep in touch.</p>
<p>(They is genderqueer in this case. I’m not gonna refer to someone by a pronoun they don’t like just because it’s easier for people who don’t even know them. That would be the opposite of progress.)</p>

<p>Even if I see my crush at all, I feel powerless right now. I do feel okay when writing with her, it’s afterwards that I really just feel depressed.
My friend suggested that I either just go for any of the girls at the university I’m getting into (yes, “university”, I mistook it as college at first) or join Tinder. He didn’t answer my question if I also could use that site on the computer, since writing a lot on mobile is plain exhausting and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I don’t know. But at least today, I don’t think I’m any mood of writing to her.</p>

<p>Update: Went out for a meal. For some reason I decided to be completely trashed. Had to, really, as it dulled the urgency to be close to them. Managed to give myself a migraine and only finished half my food, but the anxiety wasn’t as bad. They let me hug them, twice, and kiss their hand. It was okay.</p>

<p>^I get where you’re coming from. I still keep on thinking about when he hugged me like a year ago, even though it wasn’t really a big moment, and he’s probably forgotten it. Ugh, I’m pathetic.</p>

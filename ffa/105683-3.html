<p>I think the solution lies in whether or not you really want an answer - whether you desire an answer so that you can decide how to proceed with your life with or without her, or ultimately know in your heart that you wouldn’t be able to act on it even if her brain pinged positive for attraction. I believe sometimes, we don’t really want to know, because crushing is half the fun.</p>

<p>my first date was the most awkward experience of my life. I was shaky because of my shyness and nervousness, I was laughing my ass off at like nothing while she was trying to have conversation with me(no, this was before I started smoking), and so it was hard for her to take me seriousness. if I could, I would redo that whole date.</p>

Well, I did it. I asked her. But I actually almost didn’t do it.
At my school there’s math at Wednesday every week, but every second week there’s also at Monday. However, the next Monday there will be no school at all, despite that I would have had math normally that day.
That’s where it dawned on me that I should ask her.
I didn’t talk and rabble as much as usual, but that was only because I’m so behind on the math now that I tried to focus to figure out some of the x:es, y:es, that stuff. Of course, I had to ask her anyway with some of them. Anyway, the lesson ended and I patiently waited for her to be done in the bathroom. I then walked with her outside and continued talking with her a bit until we reached the bus stop. Then, when she said she had to go to other side of the way (to take a tram going the opposite direction), I said to her “Can I ask you something?”. I implied that I was worried she’d say no just to ease the ice, and stuttering I asked “Would you like to do something after school some time?” She replied “Maybe, we’ll talk about it next Wednesday.”
This has to be a good sign, right?</p>

<p>It’s a good start OSS. Did you stutter out of nervousness or as a joke?</p>
</div>
<p>I was observing her reaction as I tried to ask the question and when she mildly laughed when saying “What?” (She probably thought it was a little funny how hard it was for me to ask), I finished my sentence.</p>

Well, I did it. I asked her. But I actually almost didn’t do it.
At my school there’s math at Wednesday every week, but every second week there’s also at Monday. However, the next Monday there will be no school at all, despite that I would have had math normally that day.
That’s where it dawned on me that I should ask her.
I didn’t talk and rabble as much as usual, but that was only because I’m so behind on the math now that I tried to focus to figure out some of the x:es, y:es, that stuff. Of course, I had to ask her anyway with some of them. Anyway, the lesson ended and I patiently waited for her to be done in the bathroom. I then walked with her outside and continued talking with her a bit until we reached the bus stop. Then, when she said she had to go to other side of the way (to take a tram going the opposite direction), I said to her “Can I ask you something?”. I implied that I was worried she’d say no just to ease the ice, and stuttering I asked “Would you like to do something after school some time?” She replied “Maybe, we’ll talk about it next Wednesday.”
This has to be a good sign, right?</p>

<p>Yes, it seems to be a good sign …but OSS, are you sure she is not a NHC member, because if she is and she reads all the stuff in this thread…</p>

<p>Well, yesterday was peculiar. It went on as usual and then I wanted to ask her something, but she was in a hurry, so I wasn’t given any time. I tried to see where she went, but without her noticing. Then, when I reached her, she asked if I had been following her. I didn’t answer and instead just said I wanted to ask her something. It was about the last time when I wondered if dhw wanted to do something. She said “Oh yeah”, as if I reminded her. She then went in to say I could have just waited until next Wednesday.
Yeah.
Guess I should’ve.
I asked her if I startled her (about three times) and she said no, so she was probably just surprised.
Let’s just hope she’ll remember now in order for this shit not to be repeated…</p>

<p>Good.
I’ll keep staying positive on this. I don’t want to fuck anything up. AT ALL.
Also, yesterday it was Kanelbullens Dag (Cinnamon bun day), so I bought a cinnamon bun for her just to be nice.
She said “No thanks, I’m good”, but seemed to appreciate the offer.
Was this a unnecessary thing to do or was it worth doing this gesture?</p>

<p>That’s definitely a nice thing to do.
Though if she is in the state of mind where she’s finding you a bit over-bearing, those nice gestures can be taken the wrong way.</p>

<p>She did ask you if you had been following her. If she’s at the stage where she’s asking you questions like that, it’s certainly possible.
But regardless, you’re probably fine.</p>

<p>Well, I did catch her with surprise, so that kind of question only makes sense.
I don’t think any harm is done.</p>

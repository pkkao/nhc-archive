<p>I don’t really like romantic comedies to begin with, but I could watch those two read a phone book. They’re both just so adorable</p>

<p>Most recently, I loved Trainwreck. I can’t remember the next most recent romcom I was actually into. It’s probably been a while.</p>

<p>she seems to be ignoring me now
even though I’ve been helping her through some stuff
you can’t even help without being ostracised</p>
<p>like she told me some pretty deep family stuff and then had a panic attack over it and I managed to calm her down
then suddenly we’re here and she’s ignoring me at school and stuff
this is frustrating</p>

<p>well she’s obviously gonna need space to try to heal. remember she’s not in a really consciously sensible mental state. from what you’ve said she seems very fragile, and she might need time or doesn’t want to dwell on things. don’t try to make that about you</p>

<p>she tells me when she wants space or doesn’t want to talk and ill always tell her that it’s fine and I understand. this time she hasn’t even said that, she’s just ignoring me for no discernible reason at the moment</p>
<p>i don’t want to make it about me, I just want her to feel safe and comfortable at school and at home and for her to know she has someone to talk to about this stuff. she told me recently that she only used to tell this sorta stuff to one of my mates but that it took her years to feel comfortable around him, but that it’s different with me and she doesn’t know what it is about me that makes me so important and special to her</p>
<p>i think that’s when I started liking her, when she told me i was important to her. nobody has ever said to me that I matter to them but she did. i actually matter to somebody for once.</p>

<p>yeah I guess that’s possible
she was ignoring one of her friends yesterday too so I guess it’s not just me
i think you’re right, I’ll leave her for now and maybe talk to her at school</p>

<p>yeah try not to get too hung up about that. if you haven’t said or done anything bad to her, chances are she’s just having a bad day.</p>
<p>if it lasts a few days, ask her what’s up. don’t try to act too defensive or concerned, but just ask her how things are cause she seems a little down lately.</p>

<p>god it was awkward today
basically in her friend group is a guy and a girl (I’ll refer to them as X and Y) who are dating. another guy in that group had a party last weekend and X and Y went. Y disappeared with another guy (he’ll be J) for about an hour during that party. Y and J refused to answer their phones too. X spent forever looking for Y and when Y finally returned with J, Y refused to tell X where/why they had disappeared.</p>
<p>the guilt finally got to Y and she told X what had happened on Wednesday, a full three days after she had disappeared with J. of course it was as you expect, Y cheated on X with J, scandal scandal scandal. X wanted to fight J because of this, which is understandable.</p>
<p>anyway, I tell this story because the one I like went through about 4 separate periods of anxiety attacks and stuff. which is why I’ve been unable to talk to her. I’m gonna try and talk to her tomorrow but I don’t know if I’ll just bottle it. she’s a broken glass window that’s been put together without anything sticking the shards together. I’m afraid if I say anything to her she’ll get upset and I don’t know how to deal with something like that in real life.</p>
<p>I mean I’ll definitely try and talk to her and if she panics I’ll try and calm her down and make her happy and stuff. I’m just worried about what I’m gonna say and it’s been stressing me out so much.</p>
<p>oh and she wasn’t ignoring me she actually did lose her phone. good thing I didn’t say anything to her about it. she didn’t tell me she got it back today though even though I’m the one she talks to the most.</p>
<p>…basically I’m overthinking everything and I’m fucked up because of it</p>

<p>Come on now, noodle. You are not fucked up for being worried over her not talking to you. It’s natural that you are feeling like this.</p>
<p>But yeah, as soon as you get a chance to talk to her… do it. But by the sounds of it she seems to have deeply rooted psychological problems which makes her quite hard to reach sometimes, even when it comes to her best friends.</p>

<p>On the bright side, this is everyone’s problem sometimes.</p>
<p>Even in stable, long relationship between two people who have fairly open communication, there are hiccups like this. And if, say, one of those people is an introvert who needs time and space alone to recharge before they can rejoin everyone, then that still needs to be respected and be able to happen despite how close the couple is, you know?</p>
<p>Just continue to respect her space while showing her you’re there when she needs and don’t try to force anything otherwise.</p>

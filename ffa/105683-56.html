<p>Confessed a little too early, I’m sure that’s never happened to someone else before tho  : / It went down like “I don’t see you that way, dating isn’t right” but still “Let’s Bee Friends” and all that… This is an awesome person who I want to hang more with, but guh now it’s all awkward and stuff <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>angst. I am not good at dealing with this. I am unsocial, obsessive and a romantic perfectionist. (I guess we can all be, at times, tho)</p>

<p>Can’t tell if it’s you or them that just wanted to be friends. The “confessed” thing made me assume it was them but then you said YOU wanted to “hang”</p>
<p>Assuming the latter, I have no idea. So this post isn’t contributing anything. But just stay friends and act charming I guess</p>
<p>If the former, idk, don’t make a big deal out of it and I assume it’ll be forgotten eventually? I suck at this.</p>

<p>Ah, i meant I confessed, and I want to still remain friends and hang out. The whole ordeal is, we didn’t really hang out very much to begin with, even though I’d like to.
But first of all, wow I wasn’t ignored!</p>

<p>There’s not really much to do except just try to be friends, I guess. If that’s what you want, then make more of an effort to hang out with no strings attached?</p>

<p>we caught the train from Petrie and we talked a lot at the station, on the train and on the way to the movies
i put my hand under the arm rest just because it felt comfortable and she held my hand and it stayed that way for the whole 2 1/2 hours. people were making jokes beforehand saying that id be focusing more on her than the movie and they were right i guess
then we talked walking back to the station and on the train.
i waited with her at petrie station till her parents showed up and they and her were very appreciative
i learnt from my sister’s ex-boyfriend that you are supposed to wait with them, as he always used to just leave her whenever they went out together</p>
<p>as I said, it went well
next thursday though i think im going round her uncles lakehouse for the night</p>

<p>Well…I almost had my first date ever. I work for the school newspaper with a girl I like, but apparently we’re not allowed to date people who work with us. She said she would do it otherwise, though.</p>

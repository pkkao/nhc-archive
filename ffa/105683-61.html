<p>If you keep going after a girl who dumped you then you are a beta bitch. Amy is broken/crazy and not worth your time. So stop pursuing them and they will start pursuing you (as soon as you stop acting like you are interested in them they will suddenly be calling you and following you, and if they don’t that’s fine too because they both suck). Keep interacting with both of them, but always have them pursue you. Meanwhile, go after cool new girls. They will see you as more attractive <em>because</em> you have these other two dumb girls interested in you, and because they see you blowing off those girls instead of grovelling after them, you will look like a pimp to them and they will want you more.</p>

<p>Hi Noodlesoup,</p>
<p>I can’t offer any direct advice because you have to weigh up the costs and benefits based your characteristics, responses and circumstances. But it might be helpful if you pay less attention to gossip and reflect for yourself whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that she faked an anxiety attack. Gossip, like any form of engagement, is intended primarily to communicate information that panders to the masses. Also, even if she did, it might genuinely not be because of you personally. Sometimes it’s easier to get answers out of someone by asking them general questions around a topic that help them question themselves, rather than questions which sound accusing.</p>

<p>I didn’t get any chance to ask her out during the weekend. Ran into her at a sorority party, but I left pretty fast as I had a strong anxiety going on that day, plus other issues that I’m going to get an evaluation on later this year. With finals week all that is left, I really don’t know how to ask her. I never see her on a regular basis, she’s not in my classes, I just have her in social media contact. I’ve heard that asking in person is the only way to go, but I don’t know what to do.</p>

<p>Why did you act like it was Neighbors 2: Sorority War? Just ask her out.
Ask her in the social media if you have her there, could hardly hurt. It makes no difference asking someone in real life versus social media, even though I once was of that notion myself.</p>

<p>I didn’t act like it was Neighbors, it’s just that I had a small anxiety attack when I had arrived due to the crowd, and I think it might be a sensitive height of paranoia I’ve had since it was the weekend that cops were moving from place-to-place to bust parties. I didn’t want to be in the mix, so I left. Later that night, I had 5 people in my room, and I again had a small anxiety attack and requested that everyone leave. I don’t know what is wrong with me, hence why I’m trying to get an evaluation done later this summer.</p>

<p>Do you have her number? If not, then I guess get it next time you talk to her. If she won’t give you her number she definitely won’t go out with you.</p>

<p>Just realised my earlier post makes it look like i’m stealing someone’s girlfriend and that’s really not the case. They’re not going out and this guy is being very intense.</p>

<p>&#64;Startug technically you should do what works for you, and if social media is the only way you can comfortably do it right now (especially if you don’t see her often and aren’t in any classes together) then it’s an option, much like texting. However, if you intend on physically going out with someone, probably best to try to speak to them in person as much as possible and learn to be comfortable in their presence. I realize that’d be hard when you don’t see each other but maybe just chat over social media for a bit until you find a way to meet up with her. Maybe through chatting you’ll find out something that interests both of you enough that you can make a meet up out of it.</p>

<p>That’s actually a good idea. I think chatting would be a good idea to build up for a while. I’m hoping she’ll hang out with me before the semester is over so I can see her during break.</p>

<p>can someone tell me if i’m being really dicked around with here?</p>
<p>my best friend who i have a crush on is seeing a girl at the moment. he’s insisting that he’s not dating her but he met up with her on saturday and i’m pretty certain he met up with her today so i have my suspicions. and like it’s pretty weird that he would keep insisting he’s not dating her without me provoking him to. as if maybe he’s trying to hide it from me.</p>
<p>so i happened to be with him on saturday night after he met up with the girl, and he was being uncharacteristically friendly and flirty with me (he hasn’t been doing this for like 3 months). for instance we were watching a film at the cinema (civil war) and he kept touching his arm against mine to varying degrees of intimacy. whenever i took my arm away he would act kind of annoyed - i would notice him sighing, resting his fist on his chin or looking down at my arm until i did it again. how come the day he meets this girl he starts being all friendly and stuff with me again?</p>
<p>he only does this stuff to me. and he knows i’m gay now. so he’s either a closeted bi who’s struggling to let his feelings known or he’s just a guy who wants to be overly affectionate with me sometimes.</p>
<p>so does this guy actually like me all along but he can’t tell me, or is he just dicking around with me for banter and/or he has a new-found confidence from seeing this girl.</p>

<p>welp now i’m not sure when to do anything. the girl i want to hang out with is leaving today after she finishes finals, and I’m here for two more days. i saw her last night. jesus I almost asked to sit with her and her friends, then mine just came around the corner and I sat with them. There goes my chance of physically asking. I think my best shot is waiting until she brings up our favorite topic, asking a few questions about it, then waiting to see if I can hang out with her at some point this summer. She only lives a couple hours away in the greatest city in Ohio, so finding a place to go hang out wouldn’t be far. I’ll see what happens, but this is one of the few times where I think she admires me differently than the other girls I’ve hung out with.</p>

<p>MAJOR crushing on this tinder match. hopefully we’re gonna meet up sometime this week. lots in common and maan …. will keep yall posted</p>
</div>
<p>went on a date with this girl last night, went out to eat and walked around just a bit. had a lot of fun, I feel just as compatible in real life with her as our tinder texts suggest which is amazin. got a surprise Peck at the end too, which was so great. :&gt; this feels like so much more than the typical tinder thing i’ve been doing for a little while. we’re seeing each other again this thursday. kinda head-over-heels here</p>

<p>Try not to wait too much and don’t leave it up to her to bring up a topic to talk about. Why not give her a call or leave her a note to say goodbye and open up a door to hang out next time you have the chance?</p>

<p>I have feelings for this friend of mine and I really want to know her better. She knows how I feel and doesn’t reciprocate. It wasn’t very dramatic, basically saying “I like you you wanna date”. Showed her a dedicated drawing I made of her too, hahaha <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>cries internally</p>
<p>She is still and has always been committal in text, and puts smileys fuckin’ everywhere (I guess that just who she is though) but we haven’t done anything at all anyway, before or after. (Look I mean I’m the mother of all people who can’t take a hint) I understand it must be really difficult to consider doing something with our friends when one of them has feelings for you, and when you were already drifting apart from them to begin with though.</p>
<p>Really gonna just give it time and ask her occasionally if she wants to play LoL or things like that. Seems judicious. But arggh I miss her and I’m basically a vegetable right now.</p>

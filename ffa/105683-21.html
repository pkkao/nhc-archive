<p>I hate this mentality. Your 20s are probably going to be your best years. Your young and free to do whatever you want with your life. Screw being a teenager.</p>
</div>
<p>I like that. People should never look at their age and think they are too old or too young to do something. Just get out there and do it (unless it’s something illegal).</p>

<p>Gonna start anew. I’m going to initiate conversation with people and attempt to engage in “small talk,” even though it goes against every instinct I have. I’m not going to be quiet and remain in the background anymore; I’m going to the forefront and getting some action, dammit!</p>

<p>As a fellow aspie/introvert/whatever, I feel this sometimes. Other times I congratulate myself on all the bullshit I avoid by keeping to myself. Might come down off my high horse and attempt to enjoy trash TV, though. I find I have nothing to talk about with most people, and they tend to think I’m being obscure on purpose when I attempt to answer questions about what I actually do.</p>

<p>Well I tried it on the last day of the journalism conference on Monday, and one of the girls in my group said I was acting really weird. So how I change myself without seeming weird?</p>

<p>Do you know what it was that made them think you were weird? Maybe they just thought it was odd that the really quiet guy was suddenly trying to engage in conversation.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, I share your problem and only recently have I started conversing with my fellow students more comfortably. Just keep a friendly attitude and don’t be afraid to join a nearby conversation or discussion. Also I’m no expert when it comes to girls but sometimes the best way to make a good first impression is to just show an interest in what SHE has to say. Don’t be afraid to talk but also try not to come across as too “forward” and/or “needy”.</p>

<p>Don’t act, just be. If you’re going against your instincts, it may get noticable very fast. Just accept change doesn’t come in an instant, get comfortable with who you are right now and go with the flow. Learn from there and it will all come with time. This may sound vague, but you can’t just force it and put on an act.</p>
<p>I do think it’s good you’re taking action in going to the forefront, however. You’re not going to get anywhere by staying in the background. And sometimes you just gotta shrug the one girl off and talk to the next one. A girl you’re not compatible with may find your behaviour weird, while another one may find it charming. You care to go into more detail about what happened to paint us a picture?</p>

<p>Well it was morning, and we went to get breakfast (we were at a hotel), and I said, “Hey Valerie, ‘sup?” And she looked at me oddly and said something like, “What’s going on with you?” And I said, “Nothing. I just figure that if I want friends and relationships, I should try to initiate conversations and talk to people. So this is how I’m gonna be from now on. You dig?” And she looked at Mike, and he said, “I have no idea what happened. He was totally normal in the [hotel] room.”</p>

<p>Hmm. I’m no english native, but ‘sup’ might’ve sounded a bit weird in this case, since you’ve just spent a few days with her. It would’ve been better to ask her how he experienced/what she got out of the days at the conference or something. But hey, it’s happened, just learn from it and go on. As for your explanation to her, just think “show, don’t tell”. Like OSS shouldn’t outright tell his date he loves her right now, but show he cares about her with his actions/interested questioning. Just expand on that ‘sup’ instead next time, like with the example I’ve given above.</p>

<p>Yeah. It’s a bit odd to literally say exactly what you’re trying to do. Like, the idea of having conversation, shouldn’t really be a topic of conversation? if that makes sense. Pretty much what Luke said though.
You should just be your normal self but try to just talk more and with more confidence. To be honest though, to say what you just said, you must be ok from a confidence POV so I’d just work on your topics for small talk. I don’t know why you’re in a hotel? but if it’s your first night or whatever, something like, what do you think of the hotel? or even just something just completely pointless about the breakfast like “I’m so hungry, this looks good.. ” like just talk about whatever. People like people who talk, it makes them feel at ease because they know how to reply. Not many people like small talk so they’re happy when the other person brings up something so you should try to be that guy.</p>

<p>We stayed at the hotel during the conference, which lasted three days. And I always struggle to find topics for “small talk.” (Putting that in quotes because I despise using it as a legitimate expression) I usually end up awkwardly staring at the person I’m trying to talk to. I should make a list of topics.</p>

<p>Yeah, I get that, topics can be hard depending on how well you know the person. But if you can think of some beforehand and then TRY not to use them and just keep it going naturally as long as you can, but use them whenever there is an awkward silence, then you should learn how to naturally start conversations and build off of them from all the times you didn’t use pre-thought up topics. You’d be surprised at how easy conversations are to keep going as soon as you start. The hard bit is the initial topic but you can easily spin whatever topic you’re talking about out for a long time. Speaking of the hotel? Go “Ah I stayed in this hotel the other year and it was so weird… etc.”. You might find they had a similar hotel experience, or they might have a holiday coming up that they could tell you about. Just talk about STUFF. Something is bound to click in the other person’s brain eventually. Conversation isn’t a one-way road. And on that note, also try to think about what other people talk about. Like, did you ever hear anyone talk about something as personal as relationships and stuff as small talk? I would assume not? So, just listen to other people, and just sort of learn how things like this go. I feel it is something you’ll just get better at.
Also, try not to think too hard about what you’re going to say next. It’s worse for your brain to be going “oh man… this is awkward… what do I say…”. Throughout the rest of the day, most people will always be thinking of something random, because the human brain is just like that, so just sorta relax and get these thoughts come to you, not the “what do I say???” ones. Though don’t say literally everything that comes to mind… just… normal things.</p>
<p>Have another crack at it tomorrow morning but just keep it to basic little stuff. Don’t be afraid to go into detail on stuff, small talk isn’t an actual technical thing, so you don’t have to stick to the cliché “oh the weather’s good today” stuff but try to keep private things private.</p>

<p>Panther don’t forget that other people can really suck at small talk too so where you think you might’ve failed at conversation, it may just be that the other person “failed,” too.  Although, in this case, you were too literal about what you wanted and it caught people completely off guard with your word choice.</p>
<p>If someone in the office who never really talks to me randomly comes up and tells me “howzit?” in attempt to start conversation, I get confused for a second because I’m not expecting them to do that. And sometimes it’s really obvious that they’re forcing it which makes it more awkward.</p>

<p>Drunken bust-up with teh crush again. Oh well. Probably just gonna tell him I’m sorry I couldn’t be better/different/perfect, but I’m gonna love him and leave him because he doesn’t need my shit and I don’t really like relationships even though I do like him enough to have soul-searched for months over whether to ask him out. Truth is, neither of us is cut out for that intimacy shit. It’s just confusing when you do love the person and are attracted to them, but are both such blunt introverts that you’re sure you’d get on each other’s tits for very little payoff.</p>
<p>To be honest   &#64;Financial Panther, I’ve come out with literal things like that with some people and it was perfectly well-received (as far as I was aware, at least!). Maybe the person isn’t right for you (friend or lover) if they don’t “get” something as basic as being upfront. Most would sooner take what you said as an awkward joke than irreconcilable weirdness, but even then maybe they’re not right for you because they didn’t take it at face value.</p>

<p>I only have had one serious “obsess about them 24/7” crush in my life where it lasted throughout my whole high school career and I actually believed we were destined to end up together.  However, It ended so badly that I’ve been shut off romantically ever since.  Coincidentally, I joined the NHC in that same year.</p>

<p>I’m definitely over that specific person (I haven’t physically seen her since) but she pops up in my dreams like maybe once or twice a year and she either ignores me or accepts an apology from me and we get along until I wake up.  Other than that, I can’t tell if it’s me who is still romantically shut off or if it’s just the universe not putting me in that position again since high school is like this controlled environment where there’s actual room for a crush to be developed.  I mean I’ve been interested in people between then and now, but it’s never been the same.  I definitely long to be in a relationship, but I don’t know…I get in my own way and put up excuses, although realistic ones like me not having a job right now so I can have money and be able to do fun things.  It’s already hard enough to maintain friendships when you’re in that situation.</p>
<p>I actually had this surreal moment last weekend where I was watching 2 of my buddies play pool at a bar with this couple we just met that was probably a few years older than us. I barely ever go to bars unless my friends want to, but I was just sitting there by myself (not in any attention-seeking way) and was just casually watching their game.  I wasn’t drinking or anything either because it was late and I drove.  The game ends though and my friends shake the couple’s hand and the girl comes over to shake mine.  We shake but she doesn’t let go and sways my arm back and forth to the point where I’m like “what’s happening?” because she wasn’t drinking either.</p>
<p>Then she leans in towards my face and it becomes abundantly clear that we’re about to kiss and I leaned in too out of some lonely biological impulse.  The fact that her boyfriend was standing right next to her didn’t even matter for some reason.  It was like the music muffled and the bar went dark, except for me and this girl.  Of course, our chins ended up bumping awkwardly because it turned out she wanted to whisper in my ear. It’s what she said though that had to be the most beautiful thing because her tone wasn’t out of pity but of complete sympathetic sincerity as if she knew my whole story.  She said, “Don’t think you’re the lesser of your two friends.  You can be with anyone.”</p>
<p>And the only thing I can say back to her was “You can see that?” because I didn’t think I was showing any sign of vulnerablity or anything and she just nodded.  Honestly, it was probably the most rewarding thing I could have heard that night.  It was like she can tell I was getting in my own way, even when I wasn’t conscious of it in that moment and then to actually approach me without feeling threatened by that insecurity was just wonderful.</p>

<p>Turns out its easy, flirt a lot but don’t say anything because you’re a coward, then they tell you they like you instead, you get all cutesy about wanting to ask them out first, and then organise to meet up once you have money.</p>

<p>I seriously hope nobody will ever ask me out on a date. Perhaps only if i knew the person long enough, i would go. If there’s ever somenoe in my sights,  i would just try to have conversations, to hang out, like you do with friends and get to know the person that way. Rather than going to some place on a specific day and having akward time with someone i barely know.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I never like anything that my crush posts, which is probably a bit extreme but meh, better safe than sorry.
Also, is there an interesting story attached to that advice?</p>

<p>When it comes to crushes and facebook, you always have to be honest. I facebook stalk my crush severely, but I always make sure to tell him about it.</p>

<p>I don’t really stalk her as such.</p>
<p>I did back when I used facebook a couple years ago just to see what she got up to in 2011 but now I could care less.</p>

<p>Far out, and you call me stupid</p>
<p>She wouldve been 11 in 2011, and I would’ve been 12 at the time of looking at her facebook (she’s 15 this year, I wouldve been 12 in early June 2013)</p>
<p>its not like some creepy thing, I was an innocent kid back then with no malicious intention at all. Sure, itd definitely be weird if I did it now as i would clearly know what I would be doing, but at 12 I probably was just looking through her time line.</p>

<p>well seeing as you’re 13, and 2011 was four years ago, that was a pretty easy connection to come to. but ohhhh I’m sorry I forgot to look up the biasesumo wikia and do my research.</p>
<p>still weird that 11 year old girls and younger have facebook.</p>

<p>While yes it is safe to assume I’ve turned thirteen this year and that I was born in 2002, come Wednesday ill be 14 and you’ll know I was born in 2001.</p>
<p>I’d rather 11 year olds had facebook then Ask.FM or Instagram as they are more personal then facebook.</p>
<p>and I could reference Van Halen but I won’t sink that low</p>

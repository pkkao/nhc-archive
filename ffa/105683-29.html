<p>At the very least, can you just please not be like all those other assholes who cry friendzone and then dump your friend because she’s not worth talking anymore to if she’s not a love interest? ‘cause it’s super rotten.</p>
</div>
<p>Even after hearing these news, I still tried to insist we still see each other at least once more. If anything, I feel like I in vain will try to hold up the contact with her.</p>

<p>Have I ever said that? I’ve only said that Shaft is.
I’m not even close to that. I’m not even a chick magnet. I’m just a stupid fucking loser who witnesses how people get their lives back on track or hooks up with other chicks (or guys) like bread and butter while I just keep having it worse.
Now tell me how I’m not loathing myself enough?</p>
</div>
<p>Youknow what? I used to be like you, thinking that im not worthy enough and that’s exactly the reason i wasn’t attractive to girls. Try to build some confidence, people like that.
I think the best right now for you would be to take some time off, find some hobby to get your mind off from that girl, think of what you did wrong in approaching her, dont be so obsessive and just take it cool. Obviously don’t be an asshole and cut all the contact with her just because she doesn’t want something romantic with you (yet?) Act like you act with anyone, like you do with your normal friends, she already knows you have a thing for her, so don’t rub it under her nose.</p>

<p>That you get compliments back is always a good sign. I gave plenty of compliments to my crush, but barely got any back myself.
How long have you known her?</p>

<p>Well, you are in a much better seat than I ever was. She is definitely showing interest for you, so what the heck? Go for it.
As for the movie, it doesn’t really matter. I mean, you could always ask her what she’d like to see, but that’s not the most important detail.
As long as you don’t make Travis’ mistake, you should be fine.</p>

<p>I was just referencing DeNiro’s character from Taxi Driver.
And what I’m referring to is when he took the girl he was interested in to a porno theater.</p>

<p>Seems weird that she had no idea you had a crush on her after writing and drawing her a Valentine’s card. You were probably way to passive, OSS. For now try not to narrow yourself into the fantasy of your life only being ideal with her as your girlfriend and you’ll find yourself feeling better.</p>
<p>What’s the NHC stance on the going to a movie on the first date debate, anyway? Personally, I prefer to hang out at a place where I can talk to and look at the girl I’m just getting to know.</p>

<p>what, the movie/first date thing? it just seems oddly anti-social to make your first date a place where you won’t talk to them at all (because if you talk at the movies, pls die)</p>

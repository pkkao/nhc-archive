<p>I don’t post here as much anymore because I’m just waiting and waiting and waiting for everything to work out just fine. But it doesn’t.
Yesterday, I misinterpreted something she wrote (I thought she said she wasn’t busy instead of the opposite) and when I still kept writing, she asked “Why do you keep writing to me even though I said I’m doing something??”. The two question marks freaked me out, since that’s pretty much always a sign on someone being irritated (or confused, but that certainly doesn’t apply to this case) and now I don’t know if I can feel safe writing to her until it has passed three days or so.
I know she’s under a lot of stress and such (she has said so herself) but it cracks the shit out of me. I’m going nuts.
While we still talk to other and there’s no problem seeing her at school, I always feel like there’s something wrong with me. What I say, what I do… I haven’t been rude to her one single time, and I still think I’m fucking things up.
She said it will be much easier seeing each other at summer when we are free of school and so, but what if it even then will be difficult having another date with her?</p>
<p>So yeah, that’s why I almost refuse to post here sometimes even when I don’t feel so well. Because I want that feeling of insecurity to flat-out go away, as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Also, enjoy your flippin’ Thanksgiving dinner.</p>

<p>I have layers of crushes tbh. This morning I woke up with a crush on somebody I somewhat know, but barely. Yeah she’s hot, but it was like, I woke up and I just went “damn she’s hot.” After a couple cups of coffee and really waking up, it subsided.</p>
<p>Then I have another layer that takes a lot to get into: someone I very much know, and somebody I’m very close to. That layer has only been hit about 5 times in life. I act really weird around this stage and I’ve gotten better trying not to burn my bridges, so that’s a start. I’ve got a crush on one of the best girls I know at school and the only thing keeping me from telling her is that she got a boyfriend. In that case though, it gets harder trying to find somebody else when your heart is set on that one person.</p>

<p>this shit, even called you out on it.  your other post in the thread isn’t any better, even if there is a little bit of tongue in cheek going on in it.</p>
</div>
<p>“called you out” oh please, this has to be the most overused expression on this forum at times. Meat is a good source of protein, fact. Is it the only source? Lord no, I’m saying that I have trouble making a meal that doesn’t contain meat.</p>
<p>Ok, that is the most speculative attempt at creating an issue I’ve ever read on here. Seriously, the first post was 50% pisstake. I seriously think you should learn to read between the lines with things like this. We’re on a forum entirely dependent on the written word, the emphasis behind it is almost impossibly to gauge. Yet a lot of people on here (it is becoming a bigger problem) seem to intentionally create a mountain out of a molehill and remove/ignore context out of it. Is your only enjoyment of this forum to “call people out” and unmask their prejudice?</p>
<p>Loosen up. If I had actually come near anything too risque or offensive I would have an infraction. As it is I don’t</p>

<p>more or less quoting one of the points he kept trying to make in that thread.  your response is reminiscent of it, the only thing missing is the implication that things were better back in the olden days or whatever.
and this is true blue ignorance.  have you even looked into meals that you could make without using meat or dairy or whatever?  i’m sure there’s plenty of them out there.  you should’ve just gone the route i did and admit you eat meat due to laziness to try and find alternatives.</p>

<p>The thing I don’t get Mr. Black, is why you sometimes incite people or a reaction with these vague (sometimes weird) posts and then when you’re accused, you turn into this well-spoken, refined, intelligent person. Do you board drunk sometimes?</p>

<p>I can’t recall the last time I intentionally incited reaction on this forum, it just seems that this place is getting very prissy. Maybe it’s because it’s gotten to the stage where the only very active threads that create any excitement on here anymore is where someone is getting “called out”. I actually made reference to it n TC that the tom sequittar thing is the most interesting thing to happen on this forum for a while. That thing btw is not even remotely comparable to this however, that was bigotry, this is something being intentionally twisted, exaggerated and taken out of context to suit a certain agenda.</p>

<p>what individual points?  that post, and the other one before it, is one big point, that this place is boring and no fun and the second someone tries to post a jokingly offensive post they get jumped on and the only fun posts here anymore are the ones that dogpile on overtly bigoted and racist members.  sounded just like jetthead’s bitchfest from a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>“called you out” oh please, this has to be the most overused expression on this forum at times. Meat is a good source of protein, fact. Is it the only source? Lord no, I’m saying that I have trouble making a meal that doesn’t contain meat.</p>
<p>Ok, that is the most speculative attempt at creating an issue I’ve ever read on here. Seriously, the first post was 50% pisstake. I seriously think you should learn to read between the lines with things like this. We’re on a forum entirely dependent on the written word, the emphasis behind it is almost impossibly to gauge. Yet a lot of people on here (it is becoming a bigger problem) seem to intentionally create a mountain out of a molehill and remove/ignore context out of it. Is your only enjoyment of this forum to “call people out” and unmask their prejudice?</p>
<p>Loosen up. If I had actually come near anything too risque or offensive I would have an infraction. As it is I don’t</p>

is reminiscent of this

<p>I’m getting to the point where it is becoming severely difficult for me not to use the most patronizing language I possibly I can to you.</p>
<p>Ok, where did I say that the only fun posts here are offensive posts? If you think me saying meat is a good source of protein is offensive, I am very, very sorry. If you think me asking if panther was meeting a man is homophobic, I can only express my most sincerest of apologies.</p>
<p>My point is that the only occasion this forum sees rampant activity (and more than 4 people viewing a thread) it is when a witchunt comes along. Some of them are warranted, this one is not. That is a problem for the forum, that certain discussions don’t thrive, and shit ones do because certain people are intent on igniting a fuse which doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>I await my apologies from SVT for his accusations of racism, an apology from handy about homophobia, and fuck it, while I’m at it please apologize to me for calling me a dumb brit in a recent thread.</p>

<p>this is the least ignorant part of that post yet the one you are sticking by the most.  it’s not even what i took issue with, it’s the fact that there’s other alternatives to meat and you being too ignorant to realize and/or acknowledge that.  think the most “offensive” part was your snobby dismissive attitude towards brushing off “celery crackers and grapes”.  surely you are not too dumb of a brit to realize that’s not all vegetarianism is?</p>

<p>why are you so offended by my reliance on meat for subsidence? this is almost monty pythonesque in terms of the weirdest debates I’ve eve had online. and the irony of you telling me that I’m ignoring your points, seriously comeau? For a guy that is blowing the horn for less ignorance and dickish comments you are on a slippery slope here. I wasn’t offended as such by your brit comment but I was taken aback, as it was totally out of the blue and unwarranted. I’ve never abused anyone on here but obviously it’s acceptable for a select few to partake in abuse? Double standards eh…</p>

<p>the meat post was obviously tongue in cheek, I already said that and yet you ignore it….what is your actual problem? me making a jokey pro-meat post isn’t anywhere near as bad as some of the knuckle dragging comments I’ve received in this thread, and in others. When other people make jokey/dickish comments at my expense, I don’t run around crying, but if you’re going to get salty over this then that’s your issue.</p>

<p>This is very sad, but I know what handy is talking about. I had a movie date with a girl once, and tried to wrap my arm around her shoulder (I figured that was fine). But her movements indicated she wasn’t comfortable with it, so for the remaining 50 minutes I could barely concentrate on the movie and was full of angst because I had fucked up. When I apologised after we walked out she said it was fine, but it still resulted in me feeling worse than before. That’s why when I wrote about the date I wasn’t feeling entirely happy.</p>
<p>I decided after that I would never attempt a movie date again, due to this experience. Watch movies at home? Sure, then we can discuss them without any crowd bothering us. But absolutely not a trip to the cinema.</p>
<p>What’s best (for the first meet-up anyway) is doing something where the conversation is the focus of activity.</p>

she said she was unhappy, but why didn’t she tell me before? if she didn’t like me as much, why lead me on?</p>

<p>I’ve been on three movie dates in my life, I can confirm they only work if you do something afterwards that involves actually getting to know the person.</p>
<p>(Although it could also be that the two that failed involved going to see really really fucking awful films.)</p>

<p>A movie date wouldn’t be as bad if the other person literally said “I WANT to see this movie” and you go “I will take you” regardless of how good the movie seems or whatever. That’s fine. It’s not hard to have fun at a good movie, but man BvS just sounded and looked so freaking un-fun for an initial date.</p>
<p>Definitely need some kind of other activity, however I would be a person who would prefer to do all that BEFORE any movie. Eating, hanging out, etc. would all come before the movie itself. I’m always tired and sick feeling after coming out of the dark theater having stared at a giant screen for 1 hr+ and just don’t wanna do anything but go home and recover.</p>
<p>Someone on shiftercar just took a girl to a cake decorating class and that sounds so legitimately fun.</p>

<p>This is not completely true… My former girlfriend once wanted to see The Bling Ring. That suggestion made me want to shoot myself, but we still saw it.</p>
<p>We had lots of fun trashing the movie afterwards (she thought it was awful too).</p>

<p>I Know Pronounce You Chuck and Larry and Transformers 2. I hasten to add that in both cases it was the other person’s idea and also I was like 15/16 so naturally had awful taste.</p>

<p>I have been on three movie dates in my entire life that I can recall. Two of which went well, one of which was just meh. Putting how old I was at the time of each just because.</p>
<p>“The Age of Adaline” (22)
“Gambit” (19)
“Saw VI” (16)</p>
<p>“Gambit” was the meh one.</p>
<p>So y’know, can’t really knock movie dates based on my own experience, though obviously doing it as a first date with nothing else surrounding it is a pretty bad idea and I can’t imagine anyone but awkward teenagers with little money or other options opting to do it that way.</p>

<p>Movies don’t have to be good for you to enjoy them with a partner though, if it’s bad you can still have fun ragging on it together. Plus, y’know, being 16 year olds in a cinema the primary focus wasn’t on the movie itself.</p>
<p>It’s been so long since I’ve watched any of the Saw movies that the only reason I remember off-hand that it was the 6th one was that it had that Carousel trap which was also featured on the posters for it.</p>

<p>The Age of Adaline was with me. That movie was hot trash, but the date was a blast. It was the kind of date where did other stuff (dinner and arcade) too, so it wasn’t just a movie. And even though it was our first date, we still knew each other well before it.</p>
<p>I have been to more movie dates than I can keep track of, and the quality of company, other stuff we did during the date, and the quality of the movie we watched all had varying degrees of impact. I think it just depends on the person you’re with, how good of a time you’re having outside of going to a movie, and how you’re treating the viewing of it (like if you are taking a bad movie seriously, you’re gonna have a bad time).</p>

<p>My first movie “date” was technically Angels &amp; Demons with my friend who had a crush on me. Heh.</p>
<p>Online boyfriend persuaded me to watch Twilight with him and live-chat it on MSN - 16. He was the one who liked Twilight. :’) Think there were a few others with him.</p>
<p>Saw Toy Story 3 with my boyfriend at 17. Think we took my brother.</p>
<p>Jurassic World with my crush. They spent most of it commenting on the choice of guns. Cute :3</p>

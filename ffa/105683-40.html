<p>While this thread might not be your brand of coffee, I started it for a reason. Many people deal with emotional struggles when it comes to love and relationships, and when I started this thread I was confused over what I really wanted out of a relationship, and why I couldn’t seem to find true love. And so, I made a thread where me and many other worried souls could share their feelings and maybe ask for some advice on what to do from other members. But if you feel like your life is going great, maybe because you have found the one you are looking for, that’s wonderful and you are open to share that too. The point is, this thread is kind of a therapy. While I not always have gotten the response I’ve wished for, it’s still a place where I just can unload a lot of baggage and perhaps feel a little relieved after I’ve talked about it. As I frequently think about stuff like this, it’s why my posting seems a little spammy to some. But I’m doing it to keep myself together, and I’m sure most posters take comfort in being able to tell other how they feel here too.</p>

<p>Well its probably for the best. She’s going through a pretty tough time at the moment. Still getting over her ex and she’s an aspiring actress and I think that’s putting a lot of stress on her atm. We had an non-exclusive thing for a month or so but I struggle with that a bit. Was never quite sure how much I meant to her. Thought we have such a great connection though, maybe even more than my last long-term relationship. Just a strange affinity you know?  Even though she was seeing other guys ect, I assumed that she was using sex and drugs as escapism and that we had something fairly deep. She’s said a bunch of times that should would have committed to me if she wasn’t such a mess atm.</p>
<p>Anyway, I asked her if maybe we should cool things down for a while. I really care about her and didn’t want to add to make things any more complicated for her. I think she needs a reliable friend rather than a boyfriend atm.  She said that would probably be a good idea… But even though i know it’s for the best, part of me wanted her to try and make things work with me. Selfish thought i know but it made me a little sad how little it seemed to faze her.</p>
<p>She did say that she still wanted to hang out all the time though because I made her happy. But I dunno, messaged her a few times on facebook and she seems so distant. We were literally hanging out all the time, and when we weren’t we’d be on skype. I didn’t think things would feel so radically different, I thought we had something that was more than just romantic/sexual and didn’t think that would change.</p>
<p>Ah well, we’ll see. She’s got so much on atm, I shouldn’t take things personally but still a bit upset about everything.</p>

<p>So this girl just came over and well stuff happened. Seeing her tomorrow. So I guess things are back on… got a feeling things are going to end dramatically though. It’s so nice in the short-term but it seems so destined to explode.</p>

<p>Woke up and spent like an hour lying in the dark thinking how much I wanna kiss them. I’m gonna have to say something. Like, I don’t think I could live with someone ever again, or be in a relationship ever again, but at the same time I just wanna snuggle and kiss their neck and tell them they’re beautiful. I mean, they know how I feel but probably not that I’d quite happily never kiss them on the lips or interfere with their private parts or call them mine.</p>

<p>I saw this girl in school again today and we had a nice short chat. Like I said though, I wanted to establish some sort of lasting contact. So I gave her my phone number and said “Now you can contact me whenever you want to”. She smiled and accepted the number.</p>
<p>I can’t guarantee if she will call/text or not, but hey. It was still nice to see her. And there are plenty of opportunities left.</p>

<p>It honestly depends on how much you like them and whether you see it as a long-term thing. It’s not always easy dating someone with depression, but that isn’t to say it’s not worth it.</p>

<p>Yes it’s worth it. I hate to say it, but if anything there’s less competition for someone with depression because in many cases they’re so closed off that people who are less serious than you have given up. Doesn’t mean it’ll be easy, but persistence is key. Persistent, non-threatening, caring contact. Just don’t bother if you aren’t serious.</p>
<p>Source: I have depression and so does the person I’m interested in.</p>

<p>Yeah if anyhing, you are doing her a huge favor. If you are there to support and be with her no matter what, there might be a chance you’ll make her a happier person over time.</p>

<p>As long as being with her/him doesn’t make you feel low, and doesn’t put pressure on you as well. I would agree that you should give it a chance!</p>

<p>I would add “But don’t count on that happening”. Depression generally functions independently of situational variables, so being in a relationship might not fix anything even if she wants it to.</p>

<p>Just use common sense. As much as these shitty sites want you to believe  there are no sure fire ways to pick up women and there really aren’t any essentials except for not being a creeper/perv/douche.</p>

<p>I’d definitely agree that it slowly builds upon itself. As for whenever I’m around my crush, I tend to smile and laugh a bit more than I should or normally would, as if I’ve remembered a lot of my favorite jokes and overall hilarious scenes from The Simpsons all at once in an instant.</p>
<p>And even if I’m not laughing, the urge to smile is sometimes strong enough to the point of making this kind of face, as I’d still end up laughing on the inside.  It also doesn’t help that I’ve always been shy too, but at least I’m still working on it.</p>

<p>I might go off-topic with this but I feel you bro. Sometimes a funny thought crosses my mind in the moment I least expect it and I have to hold my laughter. Everybody near me goes “what the hell is that dude’s problem” but I don’t care  Also, sometimes some outright stupid thing just cracks me and I can’t help my amusement, and I just wish someone would shoot my brains out. Well, I shouldn’t complain, an unexpected burst of laughter every now and then is only healthy.</p>

<p>Let’s say there’s also a reason why I’m so paranoid before sending emails or making phone calls to people. It comes with the Aspergers.</p>

<p>A person on the Asperger’s forum practiced flirting by doing it with complete strangers he ran into. I’m thinking of trying that, but I’m not sure how. I read to just look them in the eye and smile, but you have to do it in a certain way in order to not seem like you’re creepily staring at them, which seems hard. Then compliment her on something, then hope she compliments me back, then maybe ask if she wants to eat lunch together, and then go from there. How does that sound?</p>

<p>you guys - there is nothing wrong with asking them to go eat lunch or do something if you hit it off well. that is a pretty standard way of general socialisation, to just go hey wanna go to the shops I need something or whatever after talking to them for a bit.
but the creepy smiling thing is a no-no. There is no “trick” or technique to it like just smiling at them in a certain way. You have to just get along and let it flow naturally. nothing wrong with a subtle compliment either.</p>

<p>I mean if you want to compliment people, compliment by all means. That’s a lovely sweater, have a nice day.  Then you walk away. No creepy eye-ing up or staring…that’s basically street harassment and that sounds like what someone who just actively flirts with random strangers they run into is doing. If that’s not the case, fine. But I don’t think Panther should be walking up to random people he runs into trying to flirt. Getting to know people first and then flirting sounds far better.</p>

<p>Yeah, this is what I found about the smilng thing:</p>
<p>“Now, it’s not just making eye contact with women that matters.  What’s important is how that eye contact is made.  After all if it’s done wrong, it can come off as intimidating or even creepy.  Rather than turn a girl on with eye contact, it may simply make her feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>If you want to attract women with your eye contact then you must also project a warm, friendly vibe.  And the best way to do this is by smiling with your eyes (also known as “smising”).</p>
<p>To get an idea of how this feels, think about what it’s like to laugh really hard.  Notice how after you laugh, the area around your eyes feels relaxed.  Your gaze becomes softer and is able to take in more of your surroundings.</p>
<p>That is the same kind of eye contact that attracts women.  A hard, focused, intense gaze is the one that makes women uncomfortable. The soft, warm, open gaze that comes when you smile with your eyes however, is friendlier and more inviting.  Therefore it’s a more effective way to attract women.”</p>

<p>I mean yea no girl wants to be stared at like that because it’s obvious the guy has an ulterior motive ending in his dick in her somewhere.  Friendly happy people are naturally more inviting/safe to be around and interact with than people who stare at you like they want something.</p>
<p>Ok so instead of trying to entrance and hypnotize women with your gaze and eye contact, let’s instead just try being a nice person and just talk to them. Don’t worry about the staring and the smiling. Have a conversation about something, anything. Smiling and making eye contact is all a natural part of conversation since you have to actually pay attention to the other person and be pleasant and yes I know you said things don’t come to you naturally but that’s why you should just have conversations with people. You will get the practice you need to be comfortable interacting with people.</p>
<p>All the smiling and eye contact stuff is quick. It is in an instant. You don’t need to dwell on when to do it, how to do it, how long to do it. She says something that you find pleasant, smile. If you want to compliment, maybe it’ll be easier to do so in the course of conversation because a) you will have something to actually compliment with someone you’re actively talking to and learning about vs. some person on the street you just ran into, and b) stopping someone randomly just to compliment them is nice but still a bit strange, it’s more natural in conversation because you can slide into it from other topics as an aside. Also if the conversation is going well, it is naturally/chemically stimulating and may actually give you the surge of confidence to do things like ask people out.</p>
<p>In short: practicing talking and learning about the other person makes all that other pick up artist sounding junk a lot easier</p>

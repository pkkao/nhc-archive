<p>Ryan, just do something that repulses her so she would never wanna be with you. Then the temptation is gone because she thinks you are disgusting and wouldn’t accept any advances from you. For example scratch your crotch a lot and then tell her you have several STD’s.</p>

<p>I’ve had crushes before but find it naturally hard to build trust in anyone. I’m also quite introverted in my own time. Therefore unless I am seeking a relationship, in which case I would spend the necessary time to get to know them better in theory, I don’t have much trouble convincing myself that taking such a risk would have more costs than benefits.</p>

<p>I suspected people might get that understandable impression :-). Committing yourself to a relationship could involve quite radical changes in lifestyle patterns and unless you have built trust with the other person, it seems reckless to assume that won’t be to the detriment of your quality of life. Often people have underlying characteristics that don’t appear on the surface. Also, I know this sounds like a flimsy excuse and there are ways around it, but a lot of my daytime is used on other commitments such as schoolwork.  I currently don’t have a crush on anyone either.</p>

<p>my crush on my best friend has come back these last few days. we’re back to flirting - for instance he made me hold his hands yesterday and pop each finger for some reason</p>
<p>i also remembered this instance about six months ago when he said he was interested in going to an LGBT event on facebook. he told me before that he is “100% straight” (which in itself is a kind of suspicious thing to say) but obviously in conjunction with that LGBT event thing and all the flirting and physical closeness and other stuff he’s done with me… yeah i’m like 80% sure he likes me. i’m just not buying this “i’m 100% straight” bullshit</p>
<p>soon i’m gonna ask him for the first time why he would be interested in going to an LGBT event if he was 100% straight, and hopefully he’ll admit he’s bi and we might confess we like each other. which i’m fucking nervous about cause i’m scared of ruining my friendship with my best friend, but maybe it might be better for both of us in the long run</p>

<p>Ryan, just do something that repulses her so she would never wanna be with you. Then the temptation is gone because she thinks you are disgusting and wouldn’t accept any advances from you. For example scratch your crotch a lot and then tell her you have several STD’s.</p>

<p>Is this the girl that you said you hadn’t really spoken to in a year?</p>
<p>Have you seen each other/spoken since the formal? maybe just ask soonish, by the end of the week or so if she’d like to hang out or get lunch or whatever. Something that isn’t the movies :x</p>
<p>If you guys had any other school events coming it would be pretty convenient.</p>

<p>I’ve run into her a few times and we’ve exchanged an enthusiastic hello, but I haven’t had a chance to talk to her past that. Like me, she doesn’t care for country music, so I’m doubting she’ll be at the big concert at my school this weekend.</p>

<p>k so
girl 1 is amy, who is at camp and is the one who ive talked about before and shes sad and stuff
girl 2 is ella who i dated</p>
<p>amy apparently faked an anxiety attack to get out of talking to me
but i was told this by ella who is known to be untrustworthy and also dumped me
amy has sent me many letters whilst shes been at camp saying that she misses me so much and that she cant wait to see me and i was the only one she wanted to hear from
amy also has a way of pushing people away when she starts becoming attracted to them, which she did to me</p>
<p>what do
i mean, i cant ask amy about the anxiety attack thing because 1: you cant fucking do that shit man 2: if she actually did fake one then ill feel like complete shit 3: if she didnt fake one then ill lose ella as a friend and so will amy
there are also other consequences that come with asking her but there are too many to number</p>
<p>fucking christ
amy is cool and stuff but if she faked an anxiety attack to avoid me then what the fuck
and ella is cool but she dumped me because she didnt like me as much as she thought she did and stuff</p>
<p>angst angst angst</p>

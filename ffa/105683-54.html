<p>What’s that old saying about how beggars can’t be choosers? If he wants to get laid that badly without spending money or forming some sort of emotional bond with a person, I say we don’t even go beyond loose change in pooling together our cash to get him a hooker.</p>

<p>Tbf Amber’s correct. Literally all he needs to do is join a band and someone will be interested. I know this for a fact. My mate’s in a band and OSS is probably more attractive than he was at the same age.</p>

<p>Being in a shoegazer band could prove to be an advantage in that respect.</p>

<p>OSS already is an artist. He creates comics, movies and he sings.</p>
<p>But he needs to work on his anxiety. Panicking after one girl he doesn’t really know stops replying on a dating site isn’t gonna help. Realize these things take time, OSS. Otherwise you’re going to appear clingy again and again. And again.</p>

<p>Agreed, just relax when it comes to things like that otherwise you’ll come across as a clingy creep with nothing but a pocketful of time and a head full of unfulfilled fantasies.</p>
<p>Just take your time  and realise that good things come to those who wait. Though if it takes too long to come I suggest you see a doctor.</p>

<p>Uuuuuuuuugh. Reach out to them when they’re down and wonder if I’ve done something wrong when I get no reply. This anxiety. Can’t even tell them how stressed this is making me, because I’ve sworn off venting in their direction due to them having enough problems of their own. I’m not gonna press them to respond because that’s really not who I am, but then again, with someone who’s basically said they don’t initiate and are insecure about friends dropping out of contact like flies for unknown reasons … how do I know for sure they won’t be hurt if I stop pushing? I need a therapist, stat.</p>
<p>Also although I know how to have lighthearted conversations, I’m bad at starting them. Guuhh. Just wanna cheer ‘em up.</p>
<p>ETA: I’m too paranoid; all good – ignore!</p>

<p>With your attitude I think even Cilla Black wouldn’t be a chance to pass, you randy fool.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, be bloody careful. We don’t want anything awful to happen.</p>

<p>In desperation lies a deep vulnerability. Always have your wits about you, especially with an older man. You may be an adult now, but with this newfound freedom and swagger comes a sense of faux-invincibilty and some guys can sense that.</p>
<p>Again, be careful.</p>

<p>Either she’s just a really really nice person in general, or she’s not indifferent towards me - … I mean, I hope it’s the latter, but I know the first is true
I think it’s so typical to be attracted to a woman who is basically just a nice person and hangs around guys a lot when you’re a pretty awkward guy with low self-esteem, but whaaaaaaatever!
We haven’t been able to catch up for a long time, but she always seem excited and always says “how fun” or “ask some other time!” but is that just pleasantry?
(obligaory “can’t believe I am posting this on a simpsons forum” but it’s not about the advice, it’s about having somewhere to wail, and anywhere is fine)</p>

<p>I honestly don’t think this dating site thing is working out for me. All I do now is browse profiles without feeling sure who I should message. Not to mention out of the people I did message, only one of them answered and she is now gone. This sucks.</p>

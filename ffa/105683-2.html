<p>oss dude, you need to space out your replies a bit. don’t get too caught up in a fleeting crush or it automatically puts you in the subordinate role, and she’ll see you as a beta male. make her work for your attention, not the other way around.</p>

<p>The only way you’re going to seem like a bitch is by openly pining over a girl. If you meant you don’t want to feel like a dick, it doesn’t make you a dick. Being a dick is insulting someone’s integrity, just because you’ve got better things to do than be at her beck and call it doesn’t make you an asshole. Get confidence and the world will fit in around you. It’s a stress-free way of living.</p>

<p>My friend just keeps nagging about a assumedly great pick-up class all the time.
If only he could shut the hell up about it already! I don’t want to have sex with a person if I don’t have feelings for her! I mean, sure, it would feel nice and all that, but afterwards, what’s the point?</p>

<p>If I want to ask her if she wants to do something, how long should I wait?
Should I go for feeling or reaction?</p>

<p>Well, he didn’t even have a problem in the first place. It was already going superwell for him and still he kept worrying about that supervisor.
I don’t know if it’s going well or not. I see no reason to worry but also no reason not to.
I want a minimum risk of her saying no, so I just want some advice.</p>

<p>whenever I’ve ever liked anybody I always just stay all extra quiet around them. occasionally talk to them but it’s pretty rare because I try too hard to think of something to say.</p>
<p>next time I have a crush on someone i’m going for it because why not, I have nothing to lose.</p>

<p>&#64;Walid Whatever you do, don’t think too much of what to say. Tell a joke. Say something stupid. Hell, even talk about the damn weather! The less time it takes for you to say something, the better.
It’s harder with someone who is shy, but still not impossible.</p>

<p>I’ve grown quite a bit out of my shyness problems when I realized I just don’t care what people think of me. obviously i’m not going to be an asshole to everyone, but even if i’m nice to someone and they’re not to me, oh well.</p>
<p>it’s also really hard to meet people when I’m staying at the homeless shelter.</p>

<p>&#64;mutilated_lips  &#64;Financial Panther I’m not worried without reason, because I’m so tired of getting a “no thanks” all the time. And I hate when I get asked “Is it a date?” How the FUCK should I answer that? If I say it is, it might result in a no, but if I say it isn’t, I’m a fucking liar.</p>

<p>I try not to look at them. We’ll speak when necessary, and while I’m excited at the thought I try to find someone else to deal with whatever I wanted so that I don’t seem desperate.</p>

<p>Update: I’ll feel like I shouldn’t contact them EVEN if I have a very reasonable reason.</p>

<p>you’ll know once you ask. i understand it’s nerve-wracking. i wrestle with fear of rejection every single day. but if you live in fear and tip toe around the real questions, there definitely won’t be an answer and no relationship will grow. if you get a “no”, at least you’ll have closure on the fear.</p>

<p>I’m the least qualified person to talk about dating on here (then again, most of us are single dorks anyway - no offense), but if you’re shy around this person now, what makes you think you won’t be equally afraid/shy on a date? If you shy away from her, chances are you don’t know her well enough to date her anyway.</p>

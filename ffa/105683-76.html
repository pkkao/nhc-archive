<p>Seems like its up to me to kick start this monstrosity again.</p>
<p>Basically… there’s this girl who I went out for a drink with last night but the situation isn’t ideal. Our parents are really close which makes me a bit uncomfortable if things don’t work out. I actually used to work for her dad and know him waaaaay better than her. Don’t think I’d even spoken to her before this week. So yeah being friends with her dad makes it feel a bit odd. She’s also only 20 which is a big age diff. I drunkenly agreed to a proper non-drinking date but not sure its a great idea tbh. She seems like a nice girl and all but I’m actually quite liking being single at the moment. Tempted to go for a casual thing but I can imagine that having the potential to blow up, especially since she’s way younger.</p>
<p>Lots of pointless rambling and over-analysing. Will just go on the date and see what happens I guess.</p>

<p>really hate that this thread is 6 years old, I voted the “Don’t say shit” option, and it’s still relevant and true today.</p>
<p>have had a crush on a co-worker of mine for a while now; been debating on telling her my feelings for a little while. overheard someone ask “So how are things between you and{boy’s name}?” and she goes on about how happy she is and whatnot. so of course, waited too long, kicking myself over and over. what would have happened if I had just said something? guess we’ll never know.</p>

<p>I’m so sorry to hear about that  It’s so hard to figure out when to tell, since you neither want to come off as pushy, nor wait so long you’ll miss your chance. I know right now it’s too late unfortunately, but next time you can ask a girl if they want to hang out so that you get to know each other at least.</p>

<p>I feel this is one of those “I feel something, you don’t so nevermind” feelings. I’ve felt something for a while; never said’/anything moments. just hurts extra ‘cause this times every single time I’m attracted to someone. god… can I please find some love?</p>

<p>I normally tend to ruin it, by either saying shit or by acting too creepy. I am in a relationship with someone, so all’s good. (for now)</p>
<p>(I would put in say shit, creepy stalker movies or later, don’t say shit)</p>

<p>I used to be a lot more nervous when it comes to talking to my crush back in middle school. I couldn’t talk to them at all and would just have quick peeks of them when I think they aren’t looking. If they’re right in front of me or if they talked to me at all, I would get super nervous and barely look at them at all, but thankfully, not to the level that I would freak out.</p>
<p>Things improved over the years, from actually talking to them in college to just friendly chit-chat in adulthood. But I still haven’t got laid. lol</p>

<p>No one yet tbh.</p>

<p>This is a lie. I’ve had crushes on people, just never recognized I did.</p>
<p>When I have a crush, I don’t do anything. No point shooting your shot when you know the answer (no).</p>

<p>My social skills aren’t great. When I’m around someone I like, I’m prone to acting like a bit of an asshole. I don’t know why exactly, but I guess it’s just a byproduct of the nerves. I do usually try to interact them when I can though.</p>

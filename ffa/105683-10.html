<p>I’ve spoken more with the girl. She’s had a pretty good break. Hung out with her friends, went to the cinema twice and one of times I wrote to her she was baking with her little brother.
Unfortunately, she has another test - in French!
Damn, does she have a lot of tests.
I personally always feel embarrassed when writing/talking to a crush, but I quickly shrug it off and am glad she’s nice to me.</p>

<p>Eh, I don’t know. She’s seemed kind of stressed out about things lately, so she hasn’t really talked to me casually quite as much, although she has thanked me for hoping things get better for her, whatever the problems are.</p>

<p>I don’t know. I don’t want to try to ask her something like that when she’s stressed out. She has been very thankful that I told her I hoped things would get better for her, though.</p>

<p>Avoid several gatherings I know they will be at so they are more likely to appreciate my company next time I do go.</p>
<p>Oh, and find myself unable to admit that I fixed a problem because they already agreed to help.</p>

<p>She still has barely any spare time over, so I still haven’t been with her outside of school yet.
She’s nice and so, but FUCK. Don’t know how longer I can take this.</p>

<p>That’s good, Panther. Did you tell her you’re hoping to be in the same class too?</p>

<p>Man, what do you do? I’m going nowhere with this!
I don’t want to tell her I like her (at least not how much I like her), but I also can’t take what a fucking doldrum this is! I’ve tried a couple times to hang out with her outside of the math lessons and the goddamn Facebook chat, but to no avail! She always has a lot going on.
I don’t know, man, maybe I should wait THREE FUCKING YEARS or whatever the hell I would have to do. Son of a bitch.</p>

<p>I’m probably just as clueless as you. She just likes my personality, I guess. I don’t really know what the hell I’m doing.</p>

<p>Yeah, I just try to get and know more about her and continue being nice. The problem is that most of the non-math related discussion is at Facebook. Now that stinks</p>

<p>Can you please just be patient? It’s fine to “go nowhere” for a period, it’s even normal sometimes; though you aren’t actually going “nowhere” if you’re still talking to and learning ABOUT her. I’m sorry but this is the most frustrating thing to sit here and listen to out of the entire thread. It always seems like young guys (in my experience ever since getting on the internet when I was 11…) just want it NOW, they just have this endgame of girlfriend in mind and try to rush the early stages just to get there as soon as possible. My relationship took 3 years to build, partly because he tried to push me into caring about him as a potential boyfriend far far far too early and it just made me hate him. It took a year of reconciliation and restarting our friendship with no strings attached and no ulterior motives before we truly meshed and fell in love. Things take time and if you’re not willing to put the time into it, it may end before it even starts.</p>
<p>…baby steps…you don’t run before you walk…good friends make good partners</p>
<p>And if she’s busy you especially don’t want to rush her into trying to hang out with you.</p>

<p>I was going to keep it quiet, but since I’m so excited…
I was talking with her about a movie I had been to and said that if she thought of one, we could go on one together. She said “Of course we can some time” and it just made me so happy!</p>

<p>♥ Not flirt at all because I know they have been sexually abused before.
♥ White knight really fucking hard to the point of legal proceedings against someone who badmouthed them, mostly motivated by shit the person said about my crush, and only partly because I’m entitled to after the way I was treated.
♥ Realise after three months that our some-say ridiculous levels of respect for each other’s personal space have left us at somewhat of a stalemate.
♥ Resolve to flirt after all. Get a … not negative response. Squee for the next twelve hours.
♥ Plan their birthday card two months ahead.
♥ Feel gutted that I’m too busy to go to a gathering they will be at this week.
♥ Grow a pair and decide to ask them out for dinner again soon.</p>

<p>I think it would be a fairly normal reaction not to get too heavy handed with someone who admitted to having been through that.</p>

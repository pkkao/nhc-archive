<p>Man, I’ve been sitting in the same sofa at school about 3 more times now waiting for the girl to show up again. And since it’s up to 2 hours every time, it’s getting pretty exhausting! But I won’t give up, the second time I saw her was because I was patiently waiting after all.</p>

<p>i dunno i can’t really comprehend someone just WAITING for someone for two hours straight just so you can get a glance at their cleavage or whatever. i mean i can understand if it’s a meet-up for a date but that’s clearly not. it’s just so you can see her and it’s weird. weh</p>

<p>Cleavage?? She’s… not dressed that way.</p>
<p>It will not just be to see her and shortly chat this time. As recommended by Matty, I will try to ask her out. If she wants to do something after school.</p>

<p>yeah but i know in your teenage mind you’re defo thinking about fuckin her the entire time you’re sitting there i mean..you can’t deny you aren’t</p>
<p>look im ‘a little sloppy right now but listen– girls aren’t super into guys sitting in a corner for 11 hours just to see thme. that might be how it works in the movies but not real life. it’s not actually romatic at all and yes it’s creepy. go ahead, ask her out i don’t care, but quit bein super weird please? for any girl you fall for’s sake</p>

<p>OSS, you do not find love - love finds you. Stare at the clouds and contemplate the leaves on the trees in the meantime. If you obsess over it, you’re bound to mess up any chance you may actually have with anyone. If you don’t know this girl, the chances are you will not get a date by walking up to her and asking her out. You’re trying to create something that isn’t there.</p>

<p>To handy: I dunno, I’m just not optimistic enough to think I’ll bump into her more randomly. I mean, hadn’t class been off last week and hadn’t I been there on the couch… I wouldn’t have seen her at all. And not seeing her again is far worse than wasting my time sitting on a couch to then small talk with her.</p>

<p>yeah I’m not really sure what OSS is expecting here? I mean it sounds like the plan is to make small talk with someone he’s barely talked to before and immediately hit it off and fall in love. but whatever don’t let me crush your dreams.</p>

<p>Ah so we’ve moved on to low grade stalking now.</p>
<p>There has to be other ways to get in touch with a student in your school that doesn’t involve sitting and waiting and staring for 2+ hours several times a week.</p>

<p>i guess i’m not really one to give out relationship advice considering i’m in a mess myself, but don’t just form an attraction for someone and expect them to like you back. not just for their sake, but for your sake as well - you’re just gonna put yourself through needless pain when you finally realise you’ve been rejected.</p>
<p>wait it out and try to forget that you’re looking for someone, and maybe if you’re lucky someone will come along without you even trying.</p>

<p>And if there isn’t a way to get in touch with her, you certainly shouldn’t resort to stalking… that’s abusive, creepy behavior.</p>

<p>it’s actually insane. “i’ve never met this girl before–but she’s super cute and she always passes this way so if i sit on this couch every day i’ll get 10 seconds to smalltalk with her and then jack off at home” what are you planning this to come to if you don’t take that step forward? even if you do it’s really really really unlikely anything will happen with it because as soon as she’s done with that you’re instatly out of her mind..or you’re creeping her out a lot and she’s living in fear of you or soemthing. that might be likely. either way it doesn’t look very good for you does it!!</p>

<p>Look, if I knew a better way to get into contact with her I would use it, okay? But I don’t. And it’s not like she notices I have just sat on the couch for 2 hours. If she doesn’t know, everything is fine.</p>
<p>I can understand your criticims, but saying she “lives in fear of me” is really fucking stretching it. What do I look like, a serial killer? No, I’m just a teenager tired of feeling like shit and extremely tired of being single. Did you know I actually contacted the girl who broke up with me over a year later wondering if it’s too late to give it another chance? It may not be normal, but I don’t want to be alone. I don’t want to move into an empty apartment. I don’t want to spend the next ten years observing how everyone else finds love. I don’t want the wonderful feeling of having someone who loves you to fade away to such a point I will have forgotten how it is like.</p>

<p>but why not look for love in more likely places? you’re not getting anywhere obsessing over some random girl you barely met/interacted with. you’re going backwards if anything and it’s pretty sad. she has no idea who you are and doesn’t care–you need to accept this</p>

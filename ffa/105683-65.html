<p>So you’re trying to do the right thing, but at no point up until that closing line does it look like you have been trying to do the right thing. It comes off like your disappointment at her not being able to make the date is more important than the reasons she wasn’t able to. If that’s the impression she’s picked up as well, all you can really do is apologise. I lost my father at 17 and maybe that affects my perspective, but if my then-boyfriend had been anything less than patient I’d have dumped his ass because it’s too much to be thinking about at such a time. I wouldn’t blame her if she feels even less inclined to bother with someone where it’s not yet a relationship and she feels she’s made no serious commitment. Really, she offered to pay you back. She offered a solution.</p>

whenever i ask my friends for advice it’s never a non biased opinion
asking here meant i got like six different responses and ive read them all and considered them all
how does this equate to me not caring about her or the situation?</p>

<p>It’s because you seem more interested in your noodle than her well-being.</p>

<p>Go here if you’re not satisfied. The opposite cohort to your friends is likely to be mainly women, which the NHC is not, and we still think what we think.</p>

<p>My turn to rant</p>
<p>So I’ve been largely steering clear of my ‘crush’ because its an impossible situation and only ever gets me down. We hadn’t chatted in a while but today a got a message from her that literally said ‘pay me attention, you’re so elusive’. So I caved and decided to chat only to get ignored. She’s online and has seen my replies but isn’t responding.</p>
<p>This sounds petty af but it’s something that’s happened a few times. I can deal with being ignored but it’s kind of annoying in this context. Was just starting to get her off my mind.</p>
<p>It seems almost intentional at this point. Am I just being cynical?</p>

<p>Ha, no, unless there’s a tonne of backstory I don’t know, it sounds like she wants your attention and is playing games. Can’t say whether that means she actually likes you, but she’s definitely trying to make you crazy. I don’t think someone would go to the effort of sending you a message asking for attention if they were just ordinary ignoring you.</p>

<p>If she saw your replies then unless it was by COMPLETE accident she clicked over to it, she’s playin’ w/ you.</p>
<p>Tell her to  ♪quit playing games w/ my ♪</p>

<p>Glad I’m not just being paranoid.</p>
<p>Haha the big messy backstory is well chronicled in this thread. We dated for like a month and she ended up with another guy who is pre abusive. Maybe that’s part of why she acts this way. He nearly beat me up a few weeks back just for having a pint with her.</p>
<p>Can’t deal with games. If she wanted to be good mates that would be awesome and tbh I’d even be fine if we drifted apart.  Just hate this awkward limbo. Keeps me thinking about her when I know nothing will happen.</p>

<p>i don’t know why, but I was thinking about an old coworker of mine, back from the good old days of cart pushing. No, not ‘blondie’; someone else. I find that thinking about her is one of the only ways to get me to smile these days. I’m pretty sure, in my mind, I thought I liked ‘blondie’ because I thought she was cute, but that’s about it. I didn’t know anything about her. I was using that as a sort of cover because of this other girl, and I just didn’t know what to say. This other girl, lets call her… K, I actually know about her, she went to the same high school as me and she was a grade below me. Looking back, I actually enjoyed going into work… when I knew she was there. We’d have conversations, make jokes, and I don’t know, I felt like I could be myself around her. I’m really antisocial, particularly around girls, but she was different. Unfortunately, I feel like I blew it with my ‘crush’ on the other girl coworker, even though it wasn’t really a crush. no idea why it took me this long to realize this.</p>
<p>me and K actually hung out outside of work a few times too. we went to go see a movie, by ourselves, and we were literally the only two people in the theater. I haven’t seen K since she left the store(since she left and I’d been fired, and I’ve been moving around since). thinking about sending her a message on facebook but i wouldn’t even know where to begin. all i know is, when i think of when i was at my happiest working, it was when I was working with her. just thinking about all the stupid conversations we’d have, or the times we hung out outside of work, is enough to make me smile. I haven’t felt this way about a girl in… my life, and it scares the hell out of me because I don’t know what to do. at all. any advice?</p>

<p>idk where else to put this i gotta vent (not about me this time)</p>
<p>ok so there’s this kid in my grade called mark and a kid called taylah. mark and taylah dated for a bit and broke up, standard stuff. marks cool but can be a real dickhead and taylah is on like 5 different sorts of medication to help with depression and stuff, but she’s also really funny.</p>
<p>backstory aside, we found out they broke up like 3 weeks into term 2. we were all like oh why you guys were so good together. turns out old mate mark was making self harm jokes to her when she self harms. i mean this is terrible in and of itself but he didn’t seem to care and was quote “glad to break up with her”</p>
<p>since then till like now ive been helping taylah get over him and i finally thought she was. she’s been really upset over the whole thing and really missed mark (?!?!) and wanted to get back together with him (?!?!?!?!?)</p>
<p>this morning i got a message from mark asking if he should get back together with her. i was like “werent u glad to dump her?” and hes like “i actually really miss her” and i said back “but you joked about self harm to someone who does it asshat” and he said “i feel really bad about it” and i just said “whatever, as long as you apologise for fucking her over” and hes like “ok cool”</p>
<p>it just sucks that people can be this shitty and get away with it. ugh</p>
<p>in other news with me tho i apologised to ella for being a dickhead about the whole situation and i was sorry for getting mad about it. she said not to worry but i said no u were going through some stuff and i was really out of line to get mad about it and she seemed pleased that i owned up to that.</p>
<p>we had year 10 social last night and this girl emily kept fixing my tie. idk if she likes me but she’s cute and if she did i probably wouldnt say no to dating her :^</p>

<p>Games may not be the right word for this in that case. Convenience, maybe. I hope she’s ok, but from experience, people saying PAY ATTENTION and then proceeding to not pay attention and send goofy messages may have other motives than falling in love. I mean by all means talk to her if you feel you can help or support her through whatever is going on, but be aware that this may not lead where you want still. Bouncing back and forth between emotions and feelings isn’t healthy for either party.</p>

<p>Like i don’t want it to lead anywhere really. Things didn’t work out and we’re not even in the same city anymore.  I still care about her though and want to help. Its just very draining and sometimes feels  one-sided. I won’t hear from her for weeks and then she’ll have some crisis and want my support. It’s tough. She’s such a good person but very self-destructive. I shouldn’t take things personally but I always do.</p>

<p>I met my girlfriend on a Google Hangouts group my friends at school started. We’d talked and fell in love. We both really love wolves a lot. But the school eventually blocked Hangouts on the school computers. So we emailed each other on the computers at school.</p>

<p>I hate the movies. But I love wolves and my girlfriend. The reason why I didn’t first see her in person is because she’s a 9th grader and me a 11th grader when we started talking last December. But shell be a 10th grader this year and me 12th.</p>

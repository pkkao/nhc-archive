<p>To be honest, I wouldn’t have posted the picture if it wasn’t for people not even reacting when Financial Panther did the same thing. I don’t think it’s nice telling so long afterwards to him it wasn’t okay instead of just doing it instantly.</p>

<p>^ I don’t even remember what that one was about.</p>
<p>Drink wine while chatting to them.
Come up with terrible puns about their favourite band as a way to flirt.
Realise that I accidentally ducked out at the perfect time not to push my luck before sending that.</p>

<p>I really am in love with her more than ever now. When I sat beside her today in math, I felt like I lost almost all of my muscles for a couple of minutes and could just barely hold up my pen. It was almost like being on fucking drugs. But at the same time, I felt sort of a peace too. Just a sudden happy feeling. I’ve sat beside her many times, but precisely that has never happened before.
Should I actually buy her a Valentine’s Gift though? I have my doubts.</p>

<p>Everyone is allowed to vent about their unanswered love crushing in here, it’s just that OSS is the only one who continues to do so for 5 months without acting upon it. Panther wrote his crush a few nice letters. So let’s say OSS has to absolutely stop doubting and get her that Valentine’s Day gift to keep the thread open? Filming her opening it is optional, but you’ll at least get a youtube unpacking video out of it.</p>
<p>Chicks dig when you draw a card yourself, OSS, but don’t put a nude Timson on it or anything. Better post your drawing here first so we can tell you if it’s appropriate to give it to her. Good idea?</p>

<p>I really am in love with her more than ever now. When I sat beside her today in math, I felt like I lost almost all of my muscles for a couple of minutes and could just barely hold up my pen. It was almost like being on fucking drugs. But at the same time, I felt sort of a peace too. Just a sudden happy feeling. I’ve sat beside her many times, but precisely that has never happened before.
Should I actually buy her a Valentine’s Gift though? I have my doubts.</p>

<p>Ask. Her. Out.</p>

<p>I don’t think she was that interested in me. So I never told her my feelings. I might email her sometime to see how she’s doing, though.</p>

<p>Curious as to the level of actual interaction y’all have with the new claims of love on your end. A Princess Bubblegum quote is coming to mind right now.</p>
<p>Get the Valentine’s gift if you want to (gifts are gifts, people like those things) but I wouldn’t make a huge deal out of the specific day, especially if not actually dating.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Get banned from Facebook for IDK no reason?</p></li>
<li><p>Ruminate for actual HOURS about how to approach that person so that it doesn’t seem like a vote of favouritism but like the reality,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>i.e. that that’s the only person who I don’t already have an alternative contact method for because I was too nervous to ask.
- Ask them. It’s bedtime. One line answer but at least rewarded with said contact details.
- Just feel like shit because I was hoping to wait a few days before casually hitting said person up again to drag them out “on the piss”.</p>
<p>But deep down, I know that it’s all OK, and I haven’t scared them off, and we will probably still do something. Ugh. It’s IMPOSSIBLE dealing with someone who doesn’t initiate. My friend today told me that my special person is unreasonable, but eh, I wouldn’t say that. I’d say I’m lucky that my special person doesn’t have issues which would actually be damaging to me (and vice versa), and my understanding will probably keep us close (I owe plenty in “being there for” as said sweetheart has catered so patiently to my own vulnerability). Frankly it is offputting to feel unrewarded in a conversation, but it’s still a preferred and workable flaw compared to those which put me off people who aren’t the living embodiment of Daria. Rather the “off” person where on a rational day I “know what they mean” by their awkwardness, than the seemingly adept person who lies to my face and bitches behind my back. (Not the same as “he’s an asshole but I can change him and it’s not like I deserve better”. I’m talking, we arrived at different but empathisable displays of dysfunction through mainly the same coping mechanisms for some same and some different life events.)</p>

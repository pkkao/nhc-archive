<p>I would say I’ve gotten progressively worse at acting normal when it comes to that. Now with this latest girl I still have hard acting normal, but I at least am toning it down a bit. I don’t give overly personal compliments and of course don’t ask stupid questions like “What do you think about me?” I also will not even have it on her mind to ask her out until she feels a strong enough connection with me. We haven’t even talked for that long yet, and while she thinks I’m nice, I can’t be entirely sure what her conception of me is.</p>
<p>Damn it, should have made it a multiple choice-poll.</p>

<p>Aside from an increased interest in being around said person in a general fashion I don’t really let on too much, though I might be a little less blunt with someone I like about certain things so as too avoid seeming like an ass.</p>

<p>I pay more attention to them than I would otherwise. I also try to be more accommodating and pleasant, because I want them to ENJOY being around me. I have never actually expected crushes to work out though, so it’s more that I make whatever time we spend together worth it every time even if we don’t like each other the same way. I never really pushed the “hey, I LIKE you” aspect.</p>
<p>Like, if I can, I try to give them things they want/like based off of minor things they say.  Example from my last crush: she liked these particular snacks at the snack shop, but the day she wanted them, she didn’t have enough money. I bought them for her and it made her happy so she shared with me.  A small moment, but it was nice to have.  Another time, she was – for whatever damn reason – bummed that none of her friends were hugging her because she liked hugging.  So I sat on that thought, and at the end of the day when we said goodbye, I told her “oh wait, I’ve got something for you” and gave her a hug.  Her reaction was the cutest, got really excited like ahhhh my hug!! Obviously, it didn’t work out like that between us, but I gained a friend for life which is just as worth it. We had a lot of little adventures after that, like risking our 1 hr break to travel to a far away mall for frozen yogurt bowls.</p>
<p>Harder to do that with guys, though, especially when they tend to spend time in their own circle of friends. Harder for me to connect with them in that particular way. Majority of my friends WERE guys but majority of my crushes were girls.</p>

<p>In the past, I would tell them right off the bat that I liked them. That never worked too well. Now I just try to use my best social skills and have nice conversations with them, but I have no idea how long I can go before telling them I like them. I often never ended up telling the girls I liked them. So I guess it’s the opposite problem from the one I used to have.</p>

<p>God, I feel so trapped now. I understand of course that she can’t talk with me all the time (not going to say her name), but I feel SO down when she doesn’t. Today she said like two sentences, neither of them even “good night” or anything. I just really hope I’ll be able to sleep, because this overwhelms me.</p>

<p>Don’t know what to tell you other than you need to let it not consume you because well…it’s a crush. Not saying it invalidates anything because it isn’t serious, but based on your opening post, it certainly shouldn’t be so serious at this point that you need to lose sleep over it and over-analyze the things she says to you (because that never ends well). Just enjoy the times you DO speak to her and that you actually can.</p>

<p>You’re probably right. It’s just that I have developed a bigger insecurity from a couple of failures and now I barely know the meaning of just relaxing and not worrying. It almost feels like every time I write to her, I wonder, no matter what it is, if I fucked up on a part and spooked her away a bit.
For example, I yesterday (or well, two days ago in Sweden) randomly sat down with her and some friends of her. I barely said a fucking… word. In the end they asked me what in the hell I was doing there (not literally in a rude way, but still) and I just carefully said “I know her a little” (referring to this girl). Fucking shit, I didn’t even say her name, that’s how weary I was. And when she said “You do?” and chuckled a little, I almost felt empty inside.</p>

<p>I didn’t know what to say, since I had no real clue how to respond to the subject matter they were talking about. I felt embarrassed, though luckily it didn’t seem to affect too much afterwards.</p>

<p>The only crushes I ever had were, in hindsight, people I should not have wasted my time liking anyway. With my ex, I just spent time talking to him and sharing things about myself in the hopes that he would start to like me back. It worked, but not long term. But after that relationship, I would be content to be finished with dating indefinitely, since it’s highly unlikely that anyone willing to meet my terms will come along.</p>

<p>I’m such a nice, non-threatening guy, and it’s always been a lot easier for me to make friends with girls rather than boys, but I don’t see any girls willing to take that next step with me. They all want the athletic, abusive boys instead.</p>

<p>I’ve been in a relationship for over three years now, so I’m starting to forget how I would act around girls I wanted to get to like me, but honestly, although sometimes I’d be a little nervous or awkward around them, I also tended to be a bit more jokey/quirky with them, and they seemed to like that and it made me relax at least</p>
<p>So yes, for the most part I would just “be myself”, but I also ramped the quirky side of me .</p>

<p>I may act a little nervous, but I can talk to them and get less nervous as the conversation goes on. I never told my first crush back from 1st grade that I liked her. I want to tell her on facebook, but I don’t know how to start it. It just seems weird to tell her there, but we live a few hours from each other so I can’t say it in front of her.</p>

<p>Oh man. It’s your downfall if you start overthinking everything. I know it’s hard, but you gotta take it easy and not torture yourself like this. Just try to build up your relationship with her whenever you got the change to talk to her, but don’t be too clingy.</p>

<p>I learned something today.
You can’t just RANDOMLY have a crush on someone. That said, I think the feelings were phoned-in. The only reason I even started talking with her is because she slightly knew me and I felt down. But after a while, I realized that I, well… stopped caring that she doesn’t talk to me. Yesterday for example, I was slightly annoyed, but didn’t think about it much either. Hell, today I’m not even going to try and chat with her.
The reason why I think it’s this way?
1. The reason it was hard to talk to her wasn’t because of nervosity, but because she didn’t say anything herself.
2. I did think she was pretty, but not really beautiful.
3. She didn’t have any really out-sticking characteristics. I’m still not even that sure what you can say she is like.
4. I felt angry rather than sad most of the times she didn’t say anything. (I’ve had experience with this before, so I am dead sure)
5. She doesn’t make comfortable ANY time I’m with her, since she isn’t even TRYING to not make me feel uncomfortable or anything.</p>
<p>Now though, I sit beside a girl at math, and the first time, I just started asking her things, like how do you puzzle out x&amp;y, and shit. But I still had the other girl on my mind. The next lesson, it was pretty much the same, only that I dared being a little more jokey and talky. After that, it felt weird. I still thought about the other one, but the feeling wasn’t as strong. Now, this time, I was more comfortable whatsoever. This was the first time I actually said “Hi” to her and I was talkier than ever. I tried to figure out some numbers by myself, but still asked her for help. I didn’t call for the teacher once. Also, when she needed help instead and called for the teacher, I didn’t make fun of her or anything afterwards. In fact, after she had helped me some more, I even called her smart and said she drew the lines much better than I did. When I said that should, she helped me make the lines better. Wow, was I surprised. I also joked pretty much every tenth minute a couple times and when the lesson ended, I asked her if I could follow her to the bus stop. She said she had something to do at first, but said “Thanks anyway”. But instead of walking away, I stayed for a little longer, waiting for her to put in all the stuff in the locker. I took the risk of waiting for her, to see if I could squeeze a word more or two before she really had to go. I asked her about her home, if she had any siblings and what she used to do outside of school. She asked at least two of the same questions back. I asked her if she liked her “siblings”, and she said they were “nice”. Then I did what could have been a huge clunker if with the right person and said “Nicer than you?”, which she chuckled at. All was well, but then I (stupidly enough) asked her if what I said was “weird”. She said, “No, not at all”. When she asked me which tram I was going to take, I said “Well, (tram) 3”. The 3 then arrived in exactly that second, and she asked if I was going with it. I said “Well… I can also take 2.” When waiting, I almost asked for her number, but decided that would be too clumsy for now, so we said “good bye” to each other. I then waved, but when I saw that she didn’t wave back, I wondered “What the fuck did I do that for?”.
Still, I’m feeling great today and one weight having left my mind, with a pillow in place of it.</p>
<p>Holy shit did I sound cheesy, but I just really wanted to share this.</p>

<p>Try not to let yourself get too badly wound up by Tinder stuff, OSS. I know it’s disheartening but you won’t do yourself any favors allowing it to upset you to the point of tears. I get that it’s more of a “Straw that broke the camel’s back” situation but if you’re able to recognize how minor a setback it really is in the grand scale of things then you’ll save yourself  a lot of emotional hardship.</p>

<p>As above. Sounds like her phone is just in the shop. I know it’s easier said than done, but one good reason to try to work on not letting things upset you so much is that people who notice you wear your heart on your sleeve are bound to use that against you if they’re inclined. If you can detach from the situation, it’ll be a nice surprise if she messages again, rather than having waited days on tenterhooks to find out she doesn’t.</p>
<p>Egh, I talk the ear off people. I talk round in circles. I go to bed and cringe at how bad the conversation was, all because I felt like I needed to talk to them, about nothing in particular. It’s no surprise that people don’t miss me.</p>

<p>So this new girl came to campus a few months ago. We’ve been hitting it off really well, then we actually had a moment where we were alone for about a half hour. It actually went bad. I think it was a mix of my sass, and her having a mean edge to sass. I’m just sarcastic.</p>
<p>We haven’t spoken since. :P For the first time in nearly half a year, I’m content being with myself for a while.</p>

<p>i also found out ella is bipolar which is why she occasionally ignores me without explanation. i haven’t been talking to her much though, only occasional conversations in real life</p>

<p>I’m gonna ask: is it morally wrong to go for a fraternity brother’s ex-girlfriend if they break up?</p>
<p>I still somewhat like the girl that I missed out on last month. She’s likely still dating one of my brothers, and while I made a code to myself that I would never take my chances, I’m reconsidering. It’s not that I have any disrespect towards them, but if they did break up, could I find a moral option? I know this is worded really weird, but what would you guys say?</p>

<p>It’s weird to think of fraternities having any sort of moral code tbh. No offense, Startug.</p>
<p>I’d say go for it only if you’re willing to deal with the drama that will surely come with it. Like, if the guy she was dating before you is still hung up on her, that’s gonna be a bit awkward to say the least seeing as he’s in your frat, but there’s no reason that them breaking up should mean she’s off-limits just because the ex is jealous. Unless you guys were best friends or something I don’t think it’s like some major betrayal you’d be pulling.</p>
<p>That said, if they’re still together and things aren’t clearly going south for them um… maybe don’t focus too much on them potentially breaking up because that’s kind of a shitty thing to do.</p>

<p>I’m not focusing on it, but I like to at least think.</p>
<p>It’s weird saying I’m in a fraternity that does have code though. What I mentioned above isn’t in the books or anything, but we do have a standard about being gentlemen. We drink, we have a good time, but we are not really a frat.</p>
<p>And yeah, I feel kinda terrible bringing that up.</p>
<p>To clarify, my code is my own. I just don’t believe in going after a brother’s girl, whether you’re close to them or not. It’s not like I’m doing anything, or wishing for them to break up. I’m just wondering. I feel like the best way to get over any of my bizarre thoughts is to talk it out.</p>

<p>Again no disrespect intended, but it’s super hard to picture a frat of “Gentlemen” outside of people pulling the ol’ Nice Guy™ routine.</p>
<p>It sounds like you’re conflicted because of this personal moral code interfering with what you actually want. I can’t really offer much guidance on that one because at the end of the day those are your own values and if you feel that strongly about them then you probably won’t abandon them. Trying to find some sort of moral loophole or whatever isn’t really something that you should have to do, because deep down the amount to which you have to go out of your way to justify your own actions to yourself should tell you something about how you truly feel about your own intentions.</p>

<p>Then I guess our fraternity would be one of the ones that works hard not only to keep its respectable image, but actually reflects how we mostly act on the inside. We aren’t perfect, but we are strict about how our Code of Conduct is taken. We don’t haze, and we usually keep our house in good shape. I know that’s not a lot, but I kinda wish you’d get to see us in person to know what I mean. Greeks get a really shitty image in the media.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just question my own morals since I really want to ask myself questions, then further wonder if I’ll ever do the right thing. Even then, I know deep down, it won’t matter much later in life unless it was catastrophic to how my life has been.</p>

<p>you don’t haze? i thought that was the main thing u did at fraternities
i think you can date her as long as she isn’t still with the other guy and it doesn’t interfere with ur relationship with him
if those things aren’t an issue i’d say ur good to go man</p>

<p>I don’t personally see an issue with it unless you and the girl’s ex are/were close.</p>
<p>But I echo what Shaun said. If it’s your moral code and it bothers you, I think it’s a clear no. Unless you’re looking to do some ideological digging and maybe update your code in a few ways at this time (I certainly did when I became pro choice at about 16), it’s probably not the best course of action. If only because if you struggle to justify it, can you live with what you did? It doesn’t really matter how many of us could live with it if you’re going to lose sleep over breaking your own code.</p>

<p>I usually can’t live with myself over really simple shit half the time. Last week, I ended up trying to flirt with this one girl (not my brother’s girlfriend) by leaving a message on her FB wall. Within a few minutes, or at least I hope so, I ended up getting brief recognition to delete the post before she ever saw it. It wasn’t anything raunchy, it was just a greeting to spark conversation. I told a few people and they laughed it off, knowing I’d be better off never speaking to her (she’s got a reputation for being a bitch).</p>
<p>But yeah. If the day ever came to when my brother and his girlfriend break up, I don’t think I would take my chances. For all I know, whatever caused them to break up may still be a factor in my own relationship. I feel shitty bringing it up, but honestly, the best way I deal with my problems now is if I tell people. Otherwise I go on depressing episodes wondering what the hell’s next for me.</p>

<p>this chick kim has been sending me pictures of her in her bra and stuff so
idk man i’m new to all this ive never been cool or attractive enough to attract any girls let alone someone like kim who is super hot
maybe it’s the new hair</p>
<p>also i’ve been trying not to text ella and i managed to go nearly a full day when she texted me about some random band thing she has to do tomorrow
which is unheard of she never just randomly texts me at 7 at night about schoolwork
i don’t wanna delude myself into thinking she missed talking to me because it’s been like a day but we always talk during the day and i’m kinda sick of it now
if she ends up missing me tho i won’t be happy because i’m so used to her treating me like shit and if it turns out all along she’s actually cared about me ill be pissed</p>

<p>man I don’t miss high school at all</p>
<p>like half of it was literally me as charlie brown pining over the little red-headed girl, except that red-headed girl blatantly told me that she’s not attracted to me yet I still did despite quite a few obvious times (in hindsight) in which other girls flirted with me.</p>
<p>kinda hard to believe that was 10 years ago, too. what I’m saying here is don’t sweat it because someday in the future you’ll be looking back on it and laugh and cringe all at the same time.</p>

<p>Oof. Yeah, that “probably” isn’t very reassuring considering the people you associate with are human garbage, Bias.</p>
<p>If you say anything at all about having them, rest assured, they will want to see and then likely will see whether you permit it or not because as soon as your back is turned your phone is gonna be nabbed and those pics will be sent to their own phones for future uses of whackin’ off/blackmail if possible.</p>
<p>I guess the main thing I’m trying to communicate here is….
That and under no circumstances should you tell any of your dirtbag friends about this. Just be thankful that someone you find attractive trusts you enough to send you these things in the first place and honor that trust by keeping your mouth shut.</p>

<p>I worked my way up to trying to go out with a new friend of mine the past few weeks. We messaged each other pretty much every night, and anyone she spoke to, I was always in conversation. She was nuts for me.</p>
<p>Then we spent 30 minutes in a car together. Alone. We’re both very “sassy” people, whereas I’m just sarcastic and goofy, while she’s almost downright mean. Since that night, she won’t speak to me. welp…</p>
<p>there’s my love life in a nutshell. a few people can’t grasp who i am, or why i am. i’m bitter and sarcastic, but i have a sweet layer underneath that a lot of people just seem to ignore. that’s why i’m worth getting to know. as much as i want to say it’s my fault, i know it’s damn well hers. damn freshmen…</p>

<p>It’s fine to believe what you want to comfort or get over this however you need to but this is really not a good way to think in the first place.</p>
<p>If you feel that you are worth getting to know, you should try to open that “sweet layer” underneath up to the right people so you don’t flat out turn other people away with negativity.</p>
<p>And it’s not worth anyone’s time to try to assign blame and fault. You seem to know the issue so just work on it.</p>

<p>I should have mentioned that I tried to, and now I read y post realizing it sounded much worse than it was. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>I opened up to her throughout the last few weeks, likes, dislikes, and what I do. She was too much for me. While she was nice, she was rather naïve and anytime I talked to her, she had to get bitchy whenever I joked around, even though I usually just laughed anytime she said something mean to me.</p>
<p>In the car, she bitched at my driving, which I’m used to add i prefer to watch how I’m driving especially if it’s not my car. In the end, anytime I did open up to her, she took a rather narrow minded approach. I’m open about my depression, and I don’t care for being accused of just being bitter. I admit i say strong things, but it’s never anything bad. She’s allowed to joke about me, but I can’t joke at her. I can’t work with that. I’m sorry if this still doesn’t make sense, but bottom line is, I want equality in a relationship.</p>
<p>I went ahead and messaged an apology to her, even though I really don’t know what happened. For whatever reason, she will probably just not speak to me. I’m alright with that. I can’t really be friends with everyone.</p>

<p>Okay, now things make more sense. I absolutely agree in general that I wouldn’t want to be in a relationship where the other is allowed to do things particularly at my expense but I am not given the same freedoms with them and am otherwise punished for trying.</p>

<p>Can’t imagine Tinder is all that reassuring if you’re already feeling shitty. I take issue with posts in the tone of “you fucking liar” in response to women who don’t feel comfortable being direct with men, though. Same as if a woman at a bar says she’s waiting for her boyfriend and she doesn’t really have one. The intention was to try not to hurt you or invite a scene; it is absolutely not as if she lied to make you feel worse, even if that’s how you come to feel after pursuing it and end up beating yourself up or looking stupid.</p>
<p>Unrelated, what I came in here to post: are men on the whole just more sexually frustrated and lonely than women? Is this because your friends don’t cuddle you or tell you that you look nice? Because, like, I doubt masturbating is harder for you than it is for me. I simply cannot imagine being so bitter - especially not outside the context of a significant individual. I must find out, o’ forum, if this is really a thing?</p>

<p>Yeah, this. TBH I find it hard to be direct a lot of the time. I looked back on some shit a former “friend” sent me a month ago and then a few months before that, where I would just mention in chat that I got a shower (because it’s a normal thing that humans do) and he would say some shit like alluding to “can I join you?” or “mental images!” and I would just be silent and one time I said “let’s change the topic because this is really weird”. I didn’t say anything like “knock it the fuck off, you’re creeping me out and YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND, YOU ASSHOLE, WHO ISN’T ME”. Trust me, I wish I had been a lot more direct, but for a lot of people that is hard and it doesn’t mean that they don’t have feelings on a subject if they say nothing.</p>

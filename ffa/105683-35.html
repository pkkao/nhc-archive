<p>Well, I’m completely sure I only have a crush on the second girl now…
All the fiddling and the ridiculous gaps between seeing each other was too consequental, so I trust the other girl much more now.
We will see each other again this Friday!</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh God Jesus Christ, I found out the first girl finally had started developing feelings for me, fuck me</p>
<p>But she will of course remain as a very good friend to me.</p>

<p>that’s a real tough break if she had just started developing feelings for you</p>
<p>is this first girl the one you’ve been after for months now?</p>
<p>also I think I might be getting somewhere. we were talking last night and she dropped like three hints about doing something together sometime soon</p>

<p>So there’s this boy I met about a month ago that I have a huge crush on. We’ve spent several nights together and I genuinely feel a bond with him that is greater than any bond I have felt before with a friend and sometimes it’s genuinely unbearable not being with him. And recently on Facebook I noticed that he said he was going to an LGBT related event, so this probably means that he is gay or bi or something right?</p>
<p>So I was thinking of telling that I’m gay, and I might discover that the feelings are mutual… And after all it appears that he supports LGBT people so he might at least understand.</p>

<p>Go for it! If he’s pro-LGBT you have nothing to lose. If he wasn’t, I’d question why you bother with him.</p>

<p>chick I like is having a halloween party on saturday</p>
<p>good news: everyone but 2 people bailed. these 2 people are male and female. therefore it’s like a double date as the dude is single and the other chick just broke up with her boyfriend pretty much for this dude. fucking yay for me cause I get to spend time with the chick I like</p>
<p>bad news: on halloween day there is a party and my mum and dad’s friends house that I want to go to. unfortunately if I go to that I’ve gotta go to a soccer game afterwards. this means I have to arrive at the party 2 hours late WHICH IS VALUABLE TIME</p>
<p>help me NHC, what do?</p>

<p>Go to the party with two friends. You’ll probably enjoy it more than the other party.</p>
<p>Either that or bring people from the family party to the party with two friends to make that one bigger.</p>

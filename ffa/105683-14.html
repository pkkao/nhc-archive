<p>cruel to be kind! but seriously if you ask the girl on valentine’s day once and for all and she rejects, then she does not like you, you should just move on.
not that things are exactly equal on these parts but imagine if that girl came up to you on valentines day and asked you to do something with her. you wouldnt think of an excuse or get out of it, you would be super happy and say yes immediately. if she doesn’t do that, she does not feel the same way about you and who wants to be in a one-sided relationship like that?
the worst kind of movement in a relationship like this is no movement. forwards or backwards, movement is good and it shows progression where you can take a viewpoint and think
“ok this is either a) worth my time to continue with her or b) that rejection was an answer to that question I’ve been pondering for months and months and now I know she doesn’t like me so I can feel sad for a little bit and then move on to the next girl.”</p>
<p>just ask her out. and if you can’t build up the courage to do it, and she makes few/little signs of trying anything with you other than the odd “maybe we could do something” once a blue moon, just realise she’s just not into you, or even face the fact you just can’t get the confidence to do it (which is a personality trait like any other that some just don’t have), get upset about it, face the truth, and start eyeing up the next girl. you could still keep a friendship with the other girl, say hello when you see her around, whatever, and maybe something could happen down the line(?) but you have to get to a point where you think is this girl really worth all these months of my life just for the little glimpses of hope she gives me?</p>
<p>also like a lot of starry-eyed people, they tend to just ignore advice/negative comments because you can’t simply switch off “feelings” but sometimes you’ve got to just realise that they’ll be plenty more crushes in your life.
take no prisoners. good luck!</p>

<p>It doesn’t sound like she’s too into you. People tend to know if they have anything booked up in the weekend. Vagueness points to “I don’t want to reject you in your face”. But I don’t know how this went down. Did you just propose on wednesday that you could maybe hang out in the weekend and have been passively waiting for an answer since? Or did you actually send her a reminder? You gotta work it sometimes without pushing it. It’s gotta come from your side, unless she so super into you she can’t wait to date. Propose an actual date next time. Valentine’s day, saturday at 7. Not ‘sometimes’, or ‘in the weekend’. Use the word date, or whatever the swedish equivalent is. And if she says no, move on. Right now it hasn’t gone beyond a crush at your 18th for Timsonsharadoldratarat’s sake.</p>

<p>Elliot, that helped me too. I’m not going to give up, because I know I can win this person as successfully as anyone else could because of their deep and serious mental health issues around trust, and any affection is great for someone like that if it’s unthreatening, but I still found your words to be a reality check. People tend to be sure what they want, and even if they express ambivalence towards being close to others and have valid excuses not to do things, if they never initiate even once, that’s not a good sign.</p>
<p>Update: crush who never initiates anything asked ME out to a regular group thing this week when I was five seconds in the door and resolute that I would NOT be asking my ritual question this week or possibly EVER AGAIN because by this point they know without a doubt that I want to see them. We had a lovely time and some deep conversation - although everything either of us ever says to anyone is fairly meaningful and honest. Communications have been civil since. I’m happy. Last night I dreamt that my crush kissed me. I never dream anything like that, or even anything that I can remember. Now I feel all warm and happy inside as if it really happened - even though I know it didn’t - because at least if I’m capable of having sex dreams (I’m demisexual and this genuinely never happens, and I often lose interest while masturbating, for fuck’s sake, so it’s a big deal) then things are on the up for me because I can still enjoy this person in some way rather than it needing to be real contact all the time, and it means I’m finally interested enough in someone for sexual thoughts to be on the cards, whether or not the relationship goes anywhere. So, even though I can’t be certain about whether it’s worth pursuing my crush, I do now know that it’s worth offering myself because I’m not completely nonfunctional in that sense.</p>

<p>She finally replied on Saturday that something showed up. She had completely forgotten that her grandmother had her birthday.
What a shame, if she just had continued to forget, maybe we could have done something!</p>
<p>Anyway, Valentine’s Day is probably not gonna work. I’m going to Stockholm the 11th and don’t remember how many days I was supposed to be there. Either case, I feel pretty certain I won’t have time that day  Maybe I’ll photograph a card I make for her, but actually have a date then? Not likely.
I really hope we can just go out soon. I mean, it’s good that it hasn’t happened too soon since we’ve gotten to know each other more and more and have a stronger bonding… But goddamn it, my heart really beats for her and I really want to go out with her soon. I don’t care if I so even have to endure the freaking Fifty Shades Of Grey movie, just as long as I do something together with her.
(I really doubt she’d want to see that movie though, but that’s beyond the point)
The next time it should not be like “That’s possible as long as I’m not booked up that weekend”. It should be way more precise, like we actually decide a location we meet at and a exact date and time. No fucking vagueness.</p>

<p>Figure out when you’ll be back, let’s say the 19th. Send her that Valentine’s card. Do you have her address?</p>
<p>Tell her
Ask her out for a Valentine’s date on the 19th, because you can’t the 14th</p>

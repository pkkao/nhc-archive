<p>have to wait another day now</p>
<p>fucks sake. it’s genuinely the most excruciating wait ever. i just really want to see this guy in person again so i can make sure whether i’m right about us. and i’m like 90% certain that i’m right.</p>

<p>so I uh actually had to do the things I didn’t want to do because my dad said so</p>
<p>the soccer game was so uncomfortable because I just kept fidgeting in my seat wanting to go. ended up watching the game on a TV out in the hallway in the stadium as I charged my phone on one of the free charger things they have, I spent nearly all my battery texting her cause she was scared during a movie</p>
<p>anyway, I got there and we had fun. she looked really nice but I didn’t get the courage to tell her unfortunately. I kinda stumbled a few of my words and jokes and probably sounded really lame but I made her laugh a lot. let her win at mario kart too, but only barely. I may not be coming first place but I can guarantee I won’t be out of the top 3</p>
<p>anyway when I left i told her thanks for having me at your place cause my mum is always adamant on manners and she laughed and said I didn’t have to thank her and it was really her pleasure and I made the night better for her</p>
<p>then she texted me the next morning saying that she had a lot of fun last night and was really glad I showed up</p>
<p>holy fuck I’m in deep here guys. teehee</p>

<p>All right fine, I’ll explain it if you promise to quit whinin’.</p>
<p>In the latest election Obama only barely made it, with 51 percent of the votes or so. That’s what I meant when I said the chances are almost as good as Obama’s win in the latest election.</p>

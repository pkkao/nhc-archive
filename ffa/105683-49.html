<p>oh behave handy, you’ve posted worse than that before</p>
<p>genuinely shocked about panther though, he has that inbetweeners vibe about him, its weird. Like OSS coming out would be. I thought panther left the S off on he, still shocked tbh</p>

<p>I honestly hope your’re taking the most contrary position on purpose for a laugh. Asking someone if they were meeting a “he” isn’t homophobic. It is expressing surprise. Any judgement of mine is entirely whatever you read into it. Maybe you’ve been conditioned to automatically read judgement into things but there was nothing there.</p>

<p>painty can ned, I blocked you a while ago, so you might as well give up trying to create controversy or paint me as some rape loving, gay hating white supremacist. I know you love confrontations like these and only ever post when one occurs but I think you should give up. haven’t got time for you after your lies and shit you posted about me.</p>

<p>probably because asking someone if they are bisexual/gay doesn’t equate to homophobia. Sorry you don’t understand</p>

<p>I never even accused them of being homophobic. You weren’t just asking them if they were bisexual. You were acting like someone being bisexual is such a crazy thing that you couldn’t believe</p>

<p>i don’t know if it was meant to be homophobic but it really does lean that way, certainly the question could’ve been worded better.</p>
<p>also i agree that it doesn’t matter what other homophobic posts he may or may not have made in the past if we are talking about the post he made a few hours ago, especially since no one even said that he’s posted homophobic material in the past.  i have seen several rather ignorant posts by goodfella(the most immediate one i can think of is in that recent vegetarian thread), but i can’t say i’ve seen anything homophobic posted by him before.  still don’t think it matters that much in regards to this specific situation though.</p>

<p>Yeah this is the real issue, because that’s exactly how it came off.</p>
<p>At this point, it’d just be great/nice if “really?” and similar can stop being the reaction to people’s sexual orientation after having assumed (should not do this) otherwise.</p>

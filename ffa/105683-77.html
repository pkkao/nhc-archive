<p>This is one great thread. It’s iconicness has brought it to be unlocked many times, just a shame I wasn’t here for the start of it. Anyway, I haven’t gone full creepiness with my girlfriend yet, I’m just slowly building it on, as a nice, friendly relationship.</p>

<p>might as well produce a crush story that nobody has heard before: three years ago I got fired from my job, but right before that a coworker was heavily flirting with me. I didn’t want to ask her out, because we’re coworkers. then I got canned. I decided to look her up on social media and could not find her. that’s it. that’s the end.</p>

<p>I’ve had sort of a boycrush on a guy lately. We’ve slept already but just as a friend thing. Though last time we hung out we made out and all that, but when I was leaving I kissed him goodbye. Even though we’ve made out and slept, I really regret that. Feels really weird. That’s more of a dating thing, as opposed to a friend hookup thing. Was really awkward. I apologized later and he said it was fine cause he liked it, but I don’t think it’s fine…</p>

<p>so there’s this girl from work I’ve been crushing on for a little while now. and it’s different than usual, because I’m actually… friends with this person? like we actually talk to each other sometimes,  we’ve hung out a couple times, stuff like that… so right now I’m in a better state with her than anyone I’ve had a crush on. well, a few weeks ago she tells me, out of the blue, that she’s leaving work, “Until restrictions are over,” and then I hear that she’s probably not coming back…</p>
<p>so, in light of all that,  I have a new response:</p>
<p>“get drunk and make an ass out of yourself via messages”</p>
<p>I had decided to get drunk and message her some shit off messenger; it was mostly like “thanks for being a good friend, I’m gonna miss you,” and stuff like that. somewhere along the way I thought it would be a swell idea to LINK “All Out of Love” TO HER{I must have planned on sending that elsewhere… but I digress}.</p>
<p>I’m a loser when it comes to love and relationships because I have never felt love, and I’ve only been in one relationship my life; but with this girl, I genuinely never have felt like this before. she’s about all I can think about… I should note that I apologized to her for my messages- sober- and she flat out said “oh it’s OK, don’t even worry about it.” like what kind of girl is going to get messages/linked love songs sent to them and NOT delete that person/hold something against them?</p>
<p>we still do talk every now and then and I am holding out hope that she does eventually return to the restaurant, but… golly. these feelings… all new to me. only took 26{!} years for me to feel… I don’t know how I feel. like I said… a way I’ve never felt before. and I wanna hold on to it… whatever that even means.</p>
